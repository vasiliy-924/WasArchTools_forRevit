Foreword
Foreword by Giuliano Digilio
Head of Technical Services, Electrical Contractors’ Association (ECA)
The IEE Wiring Regulations and more lately BS 7671 have always been important
for electrical contractors and for installation designers, and they are a key factor in
the implementation of electrical safety within the UK and indeed overseas. The
IEE Wiring Regulations go back to the end of the 19th century, almost to the time
of the very first electrical installation within the UK.
The ECA is fully committed to the development of standards for the national BS
7671 committee as well as corresponding work in both the European Committee
for Electrotechnical Standardisation (CENELEC) and the International
Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). This includes a considerable amount of work
in the preparation for BS7671: 2008.
I am pleased that you have purchased the ECA Guide to the Wiring Regulations
and I trust that this quality publication will aid to enhance the understanding
and knowledge within the electrical industry for both electrical contractors and
electrical designers.
xi
Preface
Preface
This book discusses the requirements of BS 7671: 2008, also known as the IEE
Wiring Regulations 17th Edition, published during January 2008.
The aim of the guide is to provide an explanation of the theory and reasons
behind the Regulations, their meaning and the intent of their drafting. The book
provides advice and guidance, demystifying the ‘requirements’ wherever possible.
Practical and original solutions have been provided, which are often not found in
other industry guidance.
The guide is a valuable resource for all users of BS 7671 including apprentices,
electricians who perhaps want to ‘dig a bit deeper’ into the background of the
Regulations, together with electrical technicians, installation engineers and design
engineers. Most individuals who have any involvement with BS 7671 will find the
book of considerable help and benefit in their everyday work.
To derive use and benefit from the book it is assumed that readers have knowledge
of electrical installation engineering to a basic level. However, ‘defined scope’
installers and those at similar levels will also gain from working through the book
thanks to its clear diagrams. Given these prerequisites, the book can be used as
a learning text for the 17th Edition Wiring Regulations as long as readers have
a copy of the Standard itself. Indeed, a copy of BS 7671: 2008 is required as a
reference document when using this book, and readers should at least familiarize
themselves with the terminology and definitions used in the basic Standard.
Guide to the Wiring Regulations is intended to be read on a chapter-by-chapter basis
by those involved at the level of designing and constructing installations. This is
something that is not easy to achieve with books on this subject as accessing the
basic Standard itself can be quite daunting and heavy going.
xiii
Preface
A particular emphasis or expansion has been made to those subjects that are often
confused by readers of BS 7671. In this respect the text does not wander off to
discuss ancillary subjects; the text stays focused on providing an understanding of
those concepts demanded of BS 7671 so that design and installation decisions can
be made by readers.
The book’s coverage is comprehensive, and all Parts of the Regulations have been
addressed within the topic lead chapters. Design aspects have been included as
they are integral to installations. Often, individuals or organizations consider
themselves to be either pure designers or pure installers. However, even by the
act of an ‘installer’ in selecting equipment that was unspecified by the designer,
e.g. selecting cables or other equipment, an element of design is being carried
out. The same concept is true of domestic installers who select ‘standard designs’
but perhaps feel that they do not design. These individuals are considered to
be designers even where the design is not calculated for each installation. The
adoption of a ‘standard design’ or a ‘standard cable size’ by the installer is in fact
design by the installer.
The book is arranged into topic lead chapters, at the heart of which are Chapters
C (Circuitry) and D (Selection and Erection of Equipment). Although the titles of
these chapters seem simple enough, they are comprehensive and encompass about
70% of the Regulations.
Most requirements of the Regulations have been condensed and summarized
using tables aided by clear, simple diagrams. Some tables seem quite long but they
are still very condensed compared with the regulations that they summarize. As an
example, the new Section 559 in BS 7671 includes 44 regulations, but these are
summarized in a 15-row table. The nature of the Regulations is that they must
state all facts. However, the repetition of the most basic information in the guide
was not considered beneficial; for example, where the regulation is written in the
following style:
‘cables shall be large enough for the anticipated current’
This type of regulation is either not expanded upon in the guide or it is explained
as follows:
‘cables shall be 6 mm2 minimum’.
The book includes five printed appendices and further appendices are available as
downloads from the companion website. Appendices that have been included on
the Companion Website were either considered to be non-essential for most readers,
xiv
Preface
or were items that may be subject to change at a future date. The Companion
Website can be found at: http://www.wiley.com/go/eca_wiringregulations
Although more experienced readers may wish to jump to Chapter C, the introductory
Chapters A and B are worth spending some time on. Within these chapters, the
legal standing of BS 7671: 2008 is discussed together with its relationship with
key UK law in the area of electrical installations. The general requirements of BS
7671: 2008 are also summarized within these chapters.

Requirements for
Electrical Installations
Introduction to BS 7671: 2008
BS 7671: 2008 was published during January 2008
as a significant new Edition of this fundamental
Standard.
Although the document is a British Standard, it is
also known as (and jointly labelled as) the IEE Wiring
Regulations 17th Edition; this is for copyright reasons.
In spite of the fact that the IEE changed to the IET
in 2006, the IET has maintained the brand of IEE,
mainly for use in its Wiring Regulations documents
and products. Indeed, the IEE logo appears on the
front cover and the IET logo inside the front cover.
Throughout this book, BS 7671: 2008 is referred to
as BS 7671: 2008, or variously as BS 7671, the Wiring
Regulations, the Regulations, the 17th edition or the
Standard, depending upon the particular context.
In essence, BS 7671: 2008 is virtually a European
document. In fact, two parent documents as parts
of the corresponding IEC standard have been used
or adapted.

Both IEC and CENELEC have ‘wiring regulation’ standards or rules for electrical
installations. The general structure of IEC, CENELEC and BS 7671 is illustrated
in Figure A 1.1.
Many parts of the document originate in CENELEC in a ‘harmonized document’
(HD). The parent document is known as HD 60384 and comprises virtually all
parts of the installation standard.
Within BS 7671: 2008 there are now only a few regulations that are truly ‘UK
only’, although some of the CENELEC parts of HD 60384 have been modified,
cut or expanded for BS 7671. Some of the appendices of BS 7671 are home-
grown.
The Wiring Regulations committee has also used certain parts of the corresponding
IEC document (IEC 60364) modified or virtually unmodified.
A list of the parts of the corresponding CENELEC parts of HD 60384 used in BS
7671: 2008 is shown in Table A 1.1.

BS 7671: Introduction and Overview
A 3 Overview of major changes
There is not much of the document which remains unchanged compared with
the 16th Edition; many changes were due to formal incorporation of CENELEC
drafts required to achieve harmonization.
This section gives an overview of technical changes that will manifest a change in
practice or will be something that you should be aware of. As stated in the preface
the subject of BS 7671 can be heavy going and this part of the book has been kept
as short as possible. Readers may wish to skip this part of the book and start with
the two key chapters, C and D.
The following overview notes have been included, and are listed in what is
considered to be an ‘order of significance’.
Chapter 41 Protection against electric shock
Revision of Chapter 41 is probably the most significant revision made for the 17th
Edition.
The whole structure of the chapter has been modified. The familiar terms used in
the 16th Edition of ‘direct contact’ and ‘indirect contact’ have been replaced with
‘basic protection’ and ‘fault protection’ respectively. This terminology change by
itself had ramifications in many other parts of the Regulations and these brought
about logistical modifications. The various measures are termed ‘protective
measures’.
The structure of Chapter 41 was accordingly modified. Basic protection (insulation
and enclosures) was considered something that designers and installers did not
actually ‘consider’ and was shunted towards the rear of the chapter. The extremely
rare measures of ‘placing out of reach’, ‘obstacles’, ‘non-conducting location’,
‘earth-free local equipotential bonding’ and ‘electrical separation’ were shunted
further to the rear of the chapter. Thus, the main reading in the front end of
Chapter 41 is about automatic disconnection.
There have been changes to disconnection times. There are no ‘mixed’
disconnection times and disconnection times have been introduced for TT
installations. As protection in TT installations will virtually always require an
RCD, the reduced disconnection times in the 17th Edition are easily achieved
(0.2 s for final circuits).
A very significant new Regulation (411.3.3) requires a 30 mA RCD for socket-outlet
circuits that are intended for use by ordinary persons. With a few exceptions, this

means all domestic installations. Commercial installations will generally remain
exempt, as in most such situations individuals will have received instruction.
Guidance on the structure, disconnection times and the use of RCDs is given in
Chapter C of this book.
Bathrooms 701
The 17th Edition goes the extra mile on harmonization with CENELEC for
bathroom installations.

BS 7671: Introduction and Overview
The 16th Edition introduced the concept of ‘Zones’ to the regulations for
bathrooms but fell short of harmonization with Europe in one key area: socket
outlets in bathrooms.
Section 701 now aligns with the European ethos; there is no Zone 3. Thus, outside
Zone 2, which is 600 mm from the bath or shower, only the ‘general rules’ of the
regulations apply and any equipment is allowed, although socket outlets have a
special distance specified and must be at least 3 m from the boundary of Zone 1.
All bathroom circuits now require a 30 mA RCD and a UK modification negates
the need for supplementary bonding.
Tables and methods of cable current-carrying capacity
(Appendix 4 of BS 7671)
The whole of the front end of this appendix has been modified for the 17th Edition.
The modifications include the following:
• Overhaul of the installation methods and reference installation methods.
• New installation methods for cables in domestic style insulated cavity floors and
lofts.
• ‘Rating’ factors for cables buried in the ground.
• Extensive additional rating factors for cables in free air (called correction factors
in the 16th Edition).
Swimming pools (702)
For the 17th Edition, the scope of section 702 now includes the basins of fountains
and areas in natural waters including the sea and lakes, where they are specifically
designated as swimming areas.
Lighting and luminaires
A completely new section for the 17th Edition is section 559 ‘Luminaires and Lighting
Installations’, which totals six pages of text and some 44 new regulations.
The new section deals with interior and exterior lighting installations and also
applies to highway power supplies and street furniture.
The section specifies such regulations as: ‘luminaire through wiring can only be
used where the luminaire is specifically designed for this’, ‘heat specification of
terminal wiring’, and others of a similar nature.

New appendix with current-carrying capacity of busbars
A new appendix has been added giving information on current-carrying capacity
and voltage drop of busbars and powertrack.
Chapter 56 Safety services
This chapter has been modified and specifies ‘break times’ for standby systems.
It sets regulations for such subjects as circuitry under fault conditions, parallel
operation, and specifies the life of certain critical back-up batteries.
High earth leakage currents
Correctly termed ‘high protective conductor currents’. The former section 607
has been incorporated into Chapter 54 with some limited removal of ambiguous
regulations.
High voltage to low voltage faults
A new section for the 17th Edition, but this not particularly significant for installers
or designers. The section is only relevant for ‘private’ HV-LV substations, and even
then the corresponding HV standards will need to be followed. Read Chapter D
for a fuller explanation.
Voltage drop
Whilst in essence the basic requirements of the regulations on voltage drop have
not changed, a new appendix suggests maximum voltage drops for both utility
and private supplies. These voltage drops are separated into suggested limits for
lighting and other circuits.
Atmospheric and switching overvoltages
There are a few pages of regulations on this subject, but there is not much of
significance unless you have overhead distribution cables within your installation.
Surge protective devices
Although not required, there are regulations for installing surge protective devices
(SPDs).
Insulation monitoring devices (IMDs) and residual current monitors
(RCMs)
Similarly, although optional, there are regulations for installing these devices.

Requirements of BS 7671: 2008
Introduction
It is important to recognize that, for electrical designers and installers, there are
legal responsibilities that must be both known and implemented whilst carrying out
electrical installation or electrical design work. This chapter provides information
and guidance on key UK legislation relevant to electrical installations. It also provides
guidance on some contractual obligations relating to designs and installations.
The chapter is neither a full legal guide nor a full contractual guide to requirements
but provides a short overview.
The chapter finishes with notes on the assessment of general characteristics (i.e.
Part 3 of BS 7671: 2008).
B 1 Legal requirements and relationship
B 1.1 Key UK legislation
Legislation can be in the form of an Act of Parliament (e.g. The Health & Safety
at Work etc. Act 1974) or a Statutory Instrument (e.g. The Electricity at Work
Regulations 1989). Acts are primary legislation and Statutory Instruments are
secondary legislation made under a specific Act – in the case of the Electricity at
Work Regulations, these were made under the Health & Safety at Work Act. Failing
to comply with requirements of an Act of Parliament or a Statutory Instrument is
a breach of criminal law and may result in a prosecution.
11 B
B 1.2 B
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The following legislation is considered key and relevant to the electrical technical
aspects of electrical designs and electrical installations:
• The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989
• The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2000 (as amended
2006)
• The Electricity Act 1984
• The Building Acts 1984 & 2000 (These apply to England and Wales only and
implement the Building Regulations for England and Wales including Approved
Document Part P (Electrical Safety – Dwellings).
• The Building (Scotland) Act 2003 (This applies in Scotland only and implements
the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004.
• The Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2006
• Tort
The Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EWR 1989)
The EWR 1989 is one of the most important pieces of legislation that an electrical
designer or electrical contractor must be familiar with. You should know the content
of this document as well as know of its existence.
The EWR 1989 covers the safety of people, including employees, involved in
all aspects of electrical and electronic systems in the UK. This includes self-
employed electricians working in domestic installations; all ‘electrical personnel’
in commercial installations and construction sites; and for commercial installations
the end users. It also includes any person undertaking any work activity on or near
electrical equipment.
All electrical equipment and systems are encompassed by the legislation, from a
battery to the national super grid at 400 kV. The legislation covers design, operation,
isolation, maintenance, workspace and lighting equipment. There are Regulations
on precautions for working on equipment made dead and on work on, or near,
live conductors. There are also requirements for persons undertaking work to be
competent to prevent danger and injury.
Compliance with EWR 1989 is therefore a fundamental requirement for any
organization, and it is recommended that organizations have in place a system of
training to ensure compliance with the Regulations. Guidance on EWR 1989 is
available from the Health & Safety Executive (publication HSR 25 – Memorandum of
guidance on the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989). It is recommended that organizations
12
Legal Relationship and General Requirements of BS 7671: 2008
purchase this and implement the guidance provided; it contains the text of the
Act as well as HSE guidance on how to achieve the statutory requirements. The
document details and availability are as follows:
HSE’s ‘Memorandum of Guidance on the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 – HSR 25’
ISBN 9780717662289
(50 pages, available from HSE Books and is referenced HSR25)
As well as having a copy of HSR 25, organizations must provide adequate training
for all staff that work on or near electrical installations.
To supplement this, a dead working policy should ideally be formalized together
with a live working policy for those contractors that carry out live work.
In respect of the ‘making dead or live’ working aspects of EWR 1989, the following
document is also very useful, if not essential.
HSG 85 Electricity at Work – Safe Working Practices
ISBN 0717621642
This document expands upon detail of policy and procedures for safe working
practices for people who work on or near electrical equipment. It includes guidance
on the following:
• assessing safe working practices;
• deciding to work dead or live;
• actions common to both dead and live working;
• working dead; and
• working live.
B 1.3 The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002
(as amended)
These statutory Regulations are primarily intended for distribution network
operators (DNOs), setting statutory limits for voltage and frequency.
The Regulations state that PME supplies cannot be used to supply installations
supplying caravans or boats. Also, DNOs can take the option not to provide an
13 B
B 1.4 B 1.5 B
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
earth to installations that they feel are inappropriate. This will possibly be the case
on some farms, building sites and petrol filling stations.
For all installations, DNOs will have to take a view on the safety of an installation
and will use BS 7671: 2008 for this. If the DNO feels that an installation is unsafe,
they can refuse to provide a supply or, if connected, disconnect the supply.
The Electricity Act 1984 (as amended)
This Act is primarily aimed at distribution network operators and (more recently)
meter operators. However, there is a relevant point for installation designers and
contractors to note: the Act gives the DNO or meter operator the right to position
intakes where they see fit and where they feel appropriate for a given installation.
The Building Act 1984, The Building Regulations and Part P
The Building Act 1984 refers only to England and Wales. This book does not
cover all the technical requirements relating to the Building Regulations. There are
numerous guides and books on this subject including one produced by the ECA
and the NICEIC.
However, Part P of the Building Regulations, on the subject of electrical safety
within dwellings, is summarized in this section.
Legal standing of Part P
The Building Regulations are made under the main Act of Parliament, the
Building Act 1984. The Building Act is the primary legislation and itself refers to
the Building Regulations 2000 with its various Parts on structure, means of escape,
spread of fire, ventilation, heat loss and, of course, electrical safety.
The Building Regulations 2000 are statutory and a breach of the Regulations in
itself is an offence under criminal law.
As mentioned earlier, statutory instruments such as the Building Regulations must
be complied with, otherwise a breach may result in a prosecution.
For guidance, and to specify a recognized way of complying with the individual
parts of the Building Regulations, the CLG (Communities for Local Government)
produces ‘Approved Documents’ on each part of the Building Regulations. It is
important to recognize that the Approved Documents themselves are not statutory.
This is demonstrated in Figure B 1.1.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
B 1.6 The Electromagnetic Compatibility Regulations 2005 (EMC)
Information on EMC and duties under the EMC directive and BS 7671: 2008 are
provided in Chapter D section D 4.
B 1.7 Tort and negligence
This section is included, not to scare, but to provide information on this ‘common
law’ duty.
Tort
The English legal system recognizes two forms of ‘wrongs’. The first is what we
call ‘criminal’ and may be punished by a fine, imprisonment or both. Commonly
we think of murder, but this act stemmed from an infringement of society’s moral
code, i.e. it was morally wrong to deprive someone of their life. These moral codes
were identified and legislated for, initially by the overlords, then monarchs, and
ultimately by Parliament. The Health & Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 is Parliament-
enacted law and, as such, creates a criminal obligation upon any transgressor.
The second is called ‘civil’ or ‘common’ law, colloquially known as ‘judge-made
law’ because the rules and principles have been created in the courts of the land,
enshrined by what is termed ‘the law of precedent’; that is, unless overturned by
a superior court, the ruling establishes the law and binds judges in any subsequent
cases. The civil law is concerned with providing restitution of rights, obligations or
finances in the event of some form of dispute, termed a breach.
Civil law governs both the circumstances where there is an intention to form a
relationship, by creation of a legally binding agreement – we call this the law of
contract – and where a relationship may exist but where no contract is present,
which we call the law of torts. Tort may thus be considered liability where there
is no contract.
Torts include negligence, nuisance, defamation and trespass, to name but a few.
It is possible to owe a duty in both tort and criminal law. However, if an action is
successfully pursued in a criminal court, the ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ burden of
proof being considerably higher than the civil determination of ‘viewed against
the balance of probabilities’, means that the civil liability is taken as having been
established. It is the function of the criminal compensation board to establish the
level of civil damages due to a ‘common’ infringement of rights, having established
a criminal liability.
B
16
Legal Relationship and General Requirements of BS 7671: 2008
In tort there is a need to establish a relationship. The landmark case is Donoghue
v Stevenson (1932), wherein a friend of Donoghue purchased for her a bottle
of ginger beer, found to contain a partially decomposed snail. Donoghue then
successfully established that the manufacturer owed her a ‘duty of care’ under
the tort of negligence, and hence was in a relationship, even though ‘she’ had no
direct contractual relationship with the manufacturer of her own. This ‘neighbour’
principle is important as it establishes whether a duty of care is owed or not.
The question follows: Who is my neighbour? Well, the answer is anyone who it is
foreseeable to be likely to be affected by your actions.
You can see that liability in tort is therefore very wide, and the rules governing
its implementation are extremely complex. Seventy years on, the courts are still
grappling with the principles and extent of this law.
To some extent this is why ‘collateral warranties’ are called for, because rather
than rely on the tort of negligence, parties in a collateral warranty agreement can
instead sue for a breach of contract. The level of damages may be similar or higher
and it is easier to prove a breach under contract law. We ignore ‘pure economic
loss’ and the newly enacted Rights of Third Parties Act.
Negligence
If you negligently design a system or provide a service, and as a result it causes
death or personal injury, or causes damage to other property, then you can be
held liable for these losses under the tort of negligence. Making a mistake, or
getting something wrong, is not being negligent. Being negligent is where you
are found to have performed at a level less than would have been expected by a
‘reasonable man’ whilst undertaking a task, where you had held yourself out as
being competent to undertake that task. Thus, if you hold yourself out as being
competent to design a lighting system, offer advice concerning that system, and
others rely on that advice and install what is subsequently found to be deficient, then
irrespective of payment, you may still be held financially liable. It is for this reason
that services designers and contractors are strongly advised to insure themselves
with professional indemnity insurance.
B 2 The role of Standards
Definition of Standards
Standards, including international, European and British Standards, are documents
to bring about simplification, interchangeability, terminology, methodology,
specification or codified practice.
17 B
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
A Standard is defined as:
‘A document established by consumers and approved by a recognized body that
provides for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characterization
for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree
in a given context.’
(This was taken from IEC Guide 2, 1996)
Standards are (or should be) written by industry by consensus where consensus is
defined as:
‘General agreement, characterized by the absence of sustained opposition or
substantial opposition by any important part of the concerned interests and
by a process that involves seeking to take into account the views of all parties
concerned and to reconcile any conflicting arguments.’
Legal standing of Standards
Standards are described or implicated by statute. Standards are voluntary codes
of rules, and are not law nor are they legally enforceable. Indeed, individuals may
take a view to ignore a particular standard. However, some standards are boosted
to an elevated status by being referred to either directly or indirectly in statutes.
Depending upon the wording, this can make the standards themselves have a quasi-
legal status. Again, though, there is a caveat. A good way to explain this further is
to look at how BS 7671 is referred to in some legal documents.
BS 7671 and the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EWR)
It is important to recognize that the wording of the EWR makes no mention of BS
7671. The HSE’s Memorandum of Guidance (HSR 25) states that:
‘BS7671 is a code of practice which is widely recognized and accepted in
the UK and compliance with it is likely to achieve compliance with relevant
aspects of the 1989 (EWR) Regulations.’
BS 7671: 2001 in Part P of the Building Regulations 2000
In a similar fashion, BS 7671 is not mentioned in the primary legislation, which
simply states that ‘the installation shall be designed and installed in order to protect
persons from fire or injury’.
It is Approved Document P (which itself is guidance) that mentions BS 7671.
This states ‘In the Secretary of State’s view, the (Part P) requirements will be met
by adherence to the ‘Fundamental Principles’ for achieving safety given in BS
B
18
Legal Relationship and General Requirements of BS 7671: 2008
7671: 2001 Chapter 13’. This will need updating to read correctly for BS 7671:
2008.
Standards implied or prescribed by contract
Standards are often prescribed by a contract on a definite item (stated) or by a general
contract term similar to ‘shall comply with all relevant codes and standards’.
Assuming the standard is relevant or if it is listed, then compliance with the
Standard becomes binding under the UK law of contract.
B 3 Part 3 of BS 7671: 2008 – assessment of general
characteristics
Part 3 of BS 7671, totalling only four pages, sets requirements for an overall assessment
of an electrical installation. It is intended that the requirements of Part 3 be considered
prior to the design of an installation in compliance with other Parts of BS 7671. This
works for some of the regulations in Part 3, but some are really repetitive of the general
requirements given in Parts 4 or 5.
The requirements are summarized in Table B 3.1 in just five paragraphs. The
regulation numbers have been omitted here for clarity and due to the fact that the
requirements are so general.
Requirements of Part 3 of BS 7671: 2008.
Table B 3.1 Requirement of Regulations Notes and advice
The installation shall be assessed for purpose, external
influence, compatibility, maintainability, continuity of
service and recognized safety services
The characteristics of voltage, current, frequency,
prospective fault current, earth fault loop impedance
(ELI), maximum demand and protective device at the
origin shall be determined
This can be done by inspection, by enquiry, measurement,
calculation and applies to all sources of supply. Safety
supplies shall be assessed separately and the requirements
of these are in Chapter 56 of BS 7671; see Chapter D
Installations shall be suitably divided up to avoid
danger, minimize inconvenience in the event of a fault,
reduce the possibility of unwanted tripping of RCDs,
mitigate the effects of electromagnetic interference,
and ensure effective isolation
Continuity of supply for the intended use and life of the
installation shall be considered
These requirements are discussed with recommendations
made in Chapter C
Final circuits shall be connected to separate protective
devices at distribution boards
Compatibility and EMC shall be considered See Chapters C and D

C 1 Introduction
This chapter provides information and guidance on circuitry aspects of BS 7671:
2008 and includes a significant amount of regulations associated with circuits.
For example, ‘protection against electric shock’ aspects are included. Like other
chapters, the structure is topic led and can be read in page order. The chapter
guides you through what you need to design and install circuits to BS 7671: 2008
and applies to significantly large installations. It does not cater for very large
or complex installations with, for example, interconnecting busbars, and such
complexity is outside the scope of this book.
There is a certain amount of overlap with Chapter D, and these two chapters
should both be read prior to undertaking design or installation.
Lastly, in this chapter, unlike other chapters, there are not numerous references to
individual regulation numbers. This is due to the fact that most of the circuitry
aspects are covered by relatively few regulations in BS 7671: 2008, the importance of
which cannot be overstated. Extensive background knowledge and understanding
is required to comply with these regulations and this chapter guides readers through
all relevant aspects needed.

C 2 Design procedure overview
The procedure of carrying out an electrical system design of an installation can
be quite involved and often a number of drafts and subsequent adjustments are
necessary. The following flow diagram shows the logical order of steps in the
design process.

By studying this flow chart it should be obvious that a certain number of iterations
with adjustments will be required, as a system is rarely designed without a certain
amount of to and fro.
C
22
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
The contents of this chapter will need full consideration and, when carrying out a
design in practice, adjustments will be necessary at various stages of the process.
Discrimination between all upstream and downstream protective devices may be
required for convenience or continuity of supply to essential equipment, but this
may make the electrical system over-designed (much too large for its designed use)
and thus carry a cost burden (see C 6.1).
To provide for a cost-effective and efficient design it helps if the main incoming
supply point is close to the load centre of the installation, and hence discussions
with the electricity distributor should be started at an early stage.
It is not essential that the main distribution board(s) are positioned close to the intake
point, and their position has an effect on voltage drop on the whole installation
including the submain cables.
This point of ‘positioning’ is also true of final circuit distribution boards which
need to be carefully considered in terms of voltage drop in large installations with
highly loaded final circuits. The concept of how to achieve this will become clearer
when this chapter has been read.
C 3 Load assessment
C 3.1 Principles and definitions
The subject of load assessment often comes down to experience, and there is no
substitute for this.
Many installations have major identifiable loads. In commercial premises these
usually include air-conditioning with chillers, heater banks, compressors and
motors of all types as well as lifts, lighting and user ‘final’ equipment loads usually
served by socket outlets.
A ‘newer’ load is the electrical supply to ‘data storage’ facilities (data centres).
Although beyond the scope of this book, data centres require vast amounts of
power, but between a large purpose-built data centre and an installation with a few
PCs there are installations with small and medium data storage or server rooms.
These have notable electrical power and cooling loads, and these loads should be
considered.
23
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Interestingly on this subject, whilst traditional loads such as lighting have become
more efficient, overall supply demand has increased due to computing and data
processing loads.
So, how is an installation’s electrical load quantified and estimated?
Firstly, it is important to clarify the terms used, as some of these are not defined
in BS 7671.
Connected load
Connected load (or total connected load) is taken to be the sum of all loads in the
installation.
Care is needed in specifying this load; diversity (See section C3.3) cannot be used
but duty cycle (cyclic load) considerations may need to be included.
Duty cycle
For a device or piece of equipment used intermittently, this is the cycle of starting,
operating and stopping. Also included is the time interval that elapses during such
a cycle.
Alternatively expressed, for a device or piece of equipment used intermittently it
is the ratio of its operating time to its rest time, or to total time.
Crest factor
In a periodically varying function (such as that of a.c.) this is the ratio of the peak
amplitude to the RMS amplitude.
Some may know this definition as ‘load factor’, and is not the same as duty cycle.
Both terms are further explained with the aid of an example. This example would
be needed for cyclic loads (533.2.1) evaluation.
Consider an installation with two motors of the same type installed in different
applications. One motor is used in a supply air fan, the other in a passenger lift
application. Both motors have a 20 kW motor with a full load running current of
35 amps and a starting current of 175 A. The lift is in a busy, frequently visited
building, particularly busy between 9.00 am and 9.30 am.

The duty cycle and crest factor for both motors is shown in Figure C 3.1.
Figure C 3.1 shows that both motors have the same crest factor but very different
duty cycles. The fan’s duty cycle can be taken as unity (1) and its starting current
ignored in terms of heating effect on the supply switchgear and cables. The starting
25
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
current of the lift motor, however, needs consideration, as there are 15 starting
occasions in 30 min. If the starting time was 30 s, the duty cycle would be
0.5 × 15 = 0.25
30
indicating that the motor was in starting mode for 25% of its time. From this
information, the heating effect of the duty cycle can be calculated using the fact
that the heating effect is proportional to I
2Rt. Thus, the equivalent continuous
current is
Iequivalent = √i1
2R1t1 + i2
2R2t2 = √352 × 0.75 + 1752 × 0.25 = 93 A
This result demonstrates the significance of duty cycle of the cyclic lift motor load
compared with the steady load of the fan. The lift motor supply would need to be
rated at 100 A, and the fan motor supply at 50 A (for the lift motor running current
of 35 A). It should be noted that in practice the lift motor starting current will not
be on for 30 s, this figure being exaggerated to emphasize the point.
Maximum demand
Maximum demand (or maximum power demand) is the highest rate at which
power is consumed. Alternatively expressed, it is the highest average rate at which
electrical power is consumed.
In calculating the maximum demand in an installation, diversity can be applied
(311.1).
To apply these definitions to an installation still requires appropriate experience and
usually a lack of such experience leads to an overdesigned electrical distribution
system. The author has attended many installations with 500% or greater
overcapacity with all the client’s equipment connected and running.
C 3.2 Maximum demand assessment
Maximum demand is sometimes expressed as:
maximum demand (kVA) = connected load × diversity
Diversity is discussed in section C 3.3.

There are two methods for calculating maximum demand, as follows:
• A summation of individual connected loads with application of diversity
factors.
• Comparison with table of ‘norms’ for similar installations.
In practice, a combination of these two methods is often utilized. For example,
major plant loads are calculated with duty cycle and diversity applied and this is
added to the ‘norm’ watts per square metre for general areas of the installation.
For assessment by adding individual loads there are nearly always differences
between the rated power expressed by the manufacturer, and the actual currents
drawn. This can be true despite checking catalogues and data sheets as well as rating
plates and this contributes to overdesign. More often than not, actual connected
loads are 50–70% of the quoted value.
The watts per square metre method can be used to produce an overall maximum
demand estimate, alongside information on known loads, or it can be used solely
to produce an estimate.
The watts per square metre method involves comparing the installation type
and size with a watts per square metre ‘normal’ table. Good in theory, but where
does the table come from? There have been limited central studies of this type of
‘norm’ in the UK, although consulting design firms and larger contractors collect
their own data. CIBSE (the Chartered Institution of Building Services Engineers)
does publish a certain amount of such data in its journal, but this information
is connected load and not actual running load. BSRIA (www.bsria.co.uk) also
publishes some guidance on this subject.
Table C 3.1 provides an assessment of load and would equate to the maximum
demand estimate.
The table can be used for generic designs while noting that it is an ‘average-norm’
table, and if you have significant loads not found in the average office the table will
be inaccurate. Medium-sized data centres are excluded from this table.

C 3.3 Diversity
311.1
Diversity should be taken into account when assessing the maximum demand of
an installation (311.1).
Diversity is the engineering principle that in any given installation, some of the
connected loads will not be running at the same time instant as other loads. This
principle can be further broken down into two types of load as follows:
A Loads that, due to the law of averages, will not be on at the same time.
B Loads that, due to fact, will not be on at the same time.
Examples of type A include instantaneous electric showers in a multiple block of
flats, lift supplies in general and motors for building services. Examples of type B
include electrical heating loads and electrical cooling loads; obviously, while it is
possible to run both together, the fact is that they do not. There are many examples
of both types of load.
In attempting to make an assessment of diversity, there is no substitute for knowledge
and experience. The extent of knowledge and experience needed must match the
type of installation being assessed.
It should be recognized that diversity can be applied in a number of ways as
follows:
• for items on a final circuit (except socket outlets);
• between similar final circuits, i.e. assume one circuit is 100%, the other 0% or
x%;
• between sub-distribution boards or submain cables; and
• at each main distribution board.

Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
Table C 3.2 indicates some suggested diversity factors for average circumstances
and can only be used by those with suitable experience and knowledge of the type
of installation being assessed.
It should also be noted that many engineers, technicians and electricians are
inclined to significantly overestimate loadings – perhaps to play safe – and this
leads to an overdesigned electrical system. It is more skilful to produce an ample
design with capacity built-in, but which is not grossly overdesigned. An interesting
point to note here is the supply utility’s figures for domestic supplies; they use a
figure for domestic maximum demand of about 2 kW as an average consumer
load. This figure says much about diversity when applied correctly.
It should be noted that Table C 3.2 may differ from other published data on the
subject; it is felt that Table C 3.2 is realistic, subject to the constraints given above
on experience.

C 4 Circuit design
C 4.1 Introduction
This section explains how to carry out cable sizing manually. Modern cable
sizing software programs can be quite sophisticated and, for most projects, save
considerable time. However, as engineers you must know if the inputs you are
making, as well as the outputs that you are receiving, are correct.
In this section, the design procedure common to all circuits is considered. With
reference to BS 7671, there are four separate subject areas that will determine the
cable size as follows:
Overload 43
Thermal Capacity
under fault 43
Cable Size
Voltage Drop
525
Disconnection
Time 41
These factors are considered and discussed in this chapter. Readers should note
that ultimately only one of these factors will, at any point and for a particular
circumstance, determine the cable size. Experience and some rules of thumb given
in this chapter may, for example, lead you to carry out a voltage drop check in
preference to one of the other sizing factors.
In order to visualize the cable sizing process, Figure C 4.1 provides a flow chart of
the process showing the order of stages.

C 4.2 Protection against overcurrent in general
Protection against overcurrent as defined in BS 7671: 2008 includes overload and
fault currents:
Overcurrent 43
Overload 433 Faults 434
Overcurrent
Current in an abnormal or
in a sound circuit
unintended path
It should be noted that an earth fault current in terms of BS 7671: 2008 is simply
known as a fault current; but this can cause confusion, and the term earth fault
current is used in this book. The earth fault current requirements specified in
Chapter 54 of BS 7671 are in essence the same as the short circuit requirements
specified in Chapter 43, and aspects of protective conductor sizing are therefore
included in this part of the book.
C 4.3 Overload protection
C 4.3.1 Fundamentals
There are circumstances where overload protection is not required – usually
where the continuity of the supply is critical compared with the implications of
not providing overload protection. These are discussed later.
For most circuits overload protection is required, and this protection should become
second nature to installation engineers.
A basic requirement given in 433.1 is that circuits should be arranged so that
small overloads for long durations are ‘unlikely to occur’. What is meant by small
overloads are those that will not be detected by the protective device. For MCBs
this would be somewhere between 1 and 1.45 of the rated current of the device
(see D 6.2).
C
32
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
Problems arising from not complying with this regulation are rare (cables are
usually oversized) and only an error in obtaining an accurate current rating would
cause difficulties. Another fundamental requirement of 433.1.1 is that:
Ib ≤ I
n
≤ I
z
where
Ib is the design current of the circuit,
I
n is the nominal current or current setting of the protective device,
I
z is the current-carrying capacity of the conductor in the particular installation
conditions.
Pictorially represented this requirement is as follows:

Devices will operate if the current exceeds the fusing or tripping current I2 for a
time greater than the conventional fusing or tripping time. Fusing, non-fusing and
conventional times are given for common devices in Table C 4.1.

Overcurrent devices will not operate if the overcurrent is of short duration (except
for circuit breakers where the overcurrent exceeds the instantaneous operating
current).
C 4.3.2 Design current Ib
In order to determine a correct individual cable size it is important to obtain or
calculate an accurate circuit design current. This may not be critical for short or
lightly loaded circuits, but becomes critical when sizing heavily loaded circuits
with long cable runs of, say, over 75 m. At longer circuit lengths, voltage drop
requirements can lead to cable sizes significantly larger than the base size. In
order to minimize this in calculations, an accurate design current Ib can be key in
ensuring a good design.
The basic formulae to apply to obtain a design current are as follows:
kW × 1000 (amps),
V × pf
Three-phase, I1 =
kW × 1000 (amps),
√3 V1 × pf
Single-phase equipment, I =
where:
V is the nominal phase voltage to earth, also denoted by U0
Vl is the line voltage, also denoted by U
pf is the power factor
Il is the line current in a three-phase system.
C 4.3.3 Installed cable sizing
While carrying out cable sizing to BS 7671, or indeed for cable sizing in general,
it helps to bear in mind the following principles:
• An insulated cable size is only limited by its type of insulation.
• For a given insulation, the rating depends upon both load current and the rate
of heat dissipated by the cable to its immediate environment.
The basic sizing principle is as follows:
C
34
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
First select an appropriate protective rating, larger than the design current (step
1).
Next the initial, tabulated cable size (It) is obtained by using the protective device
rating and correcting for ambient temperature, grouping factor and, where
applicable, correction factors for thermal insulation and rewirable fuses (step 2).
It =

C denotes a correction factor as follows:
C
a is ambient temperature; see Appendix C Table 4B1 (cables in air) or
4B2/4B3 (cables in ground)
C
g is grouping; see Appendix C Table 4C1 to 4C5
Ci is for conductors totally surrounded by thermal insulation. Although not
given in Appendix 4 this factor is 0.5 (523.6.6).
It should be noted that some 17th Edition tables include a certain amount of
thermal insulation and where these are used no further correction should be made.
For example, new Table 4D5, included due to ECA suggestion, includes thermal
insulation for cables in loft-roof spaces, and the Ci correction should not be used
as it is already in the It value.
C
is for semi-enclosed fuses to BS 3036.
c
A cable with tabulated current-carrying capacity (I
z) is then selected such to exceed
the It (step 3). The procedure can be depicted as in Figure C 4.2.

Current rating tables for some common cables are found in Appendix 2 of this
guide. Correction factors are discussed in sections C 4.3.4 and C 4.3.5.
On completion of obtaining an installed current rating for the relevant cable size, it
is then further checked for voltage drop, thermal withstand under fault conditions
and size for earth fault loop impedance. These are discussed later in the chapter.
As the factors for thermal insulation and fusing (semi-enclosed) are not used all that
often, Equation 1 becomes:

The various correction factors are now discussed.
C 4.3.4 Grouping factors
Firstly, caution has to be exercised when applying grouping factors; very large
cable sizes can result unless careful consideration of realistic design currents is
made before a grouping factor is applied.
C
36
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
BS 7671: 2008 Appendix 4 includes revised information for grouping factors
calculations. A new table of grouping factors for buried cables has been added
(Table 4C2 reproduced below). Also new is a method for calculating the grouping
factor for circuits where cables are of different sizes, as follows:
1
F =
√n
where F is the group rating factor and n is the number of circuits.
This formula will give a lower group factor than BS 7671 Tables 4C1 to 4C5 as
these tables assume that cables in the group are of the same size.
An overriding point to note before the grouping factor tables are given is the note
523.5 in BS 7671, which states that where a cable is known to carry 30% or less of
its grouped rating, it can be ignored for the purposes of grouping. This is invaluable
and should be utilized for BS 7671: 2008 calculations.
The procedure for applying grouping factors is either to use the factor from BS
7671 Tables 4C1 to 4C2 or to use the following method:
Compare the formula:
It = √I

with

using the larger value. This method can only be used where the circuits within a
group are not expected to be simultaneously overloaded.
For circuits that are not fully loaded, the use of this (Equation 3) method produces
a lower It than the grouping factor method using tables 4C1 to 4C5 from BS 7671.
The procedures are summarized as:

NOTE 1: NOTE 2: NOTE 3: NOTE 4: NOTE 5: NOTE 6: NOTE 7: NOTE 8: NOTE 9: These factors are applicable to uniform groups of cables, equally loaded.
Where horizontal clearances between adjacent cables exceeds twice their overall diameter, no rating factor need be
applied.
The same factors are applied to:
- groups of two or three single-core cables;
- multicore cables.
If a system consists of both two- and three-core cables, the total number of cables is taken as the number of circuits, and
the corresponding factor is applied to the tables for two loaded conductors for the two-core cables, and to the tables for
three loaded conductors for the three-core cables.
If a group consists of n single-core cables it may either be considered as n/2 circuits of two loaded conductors or n/3
circuits of three loaded conductors.
The values given have been averaged over the range of conductor sizes and types of installation included in Tables 4D1A to
4J4A; the overall accuracy of tabulated values is within 5%.
For some installations and for other methods not provided for in the above table, it may be appropriate to use factors
calculated for specific cases; see for example Tables 4C4 and 4C5.
When cables having differing conductor operating temperature are grouped together, the current rating is to be based upon
the lowest operating temperature of any cable in the group.
If, due to known operating conditions, a cable is expected to carry not more than 30% of its grouped rating, it may be
ignored for the purpose of obtaining the rating factor for the rest of the group.
For example, a group of N loaded cables would normally require a group reduction factor of Cg applied to the tabulated It.
However, if M cables in the group carry loads which are not greater than 0.3 CgIt amperes the other cables can be sized by
using the group rating factor corresponding to (N‑M) cables.

4.3.5 Other correction factors
As well as grouping factors, correction factors for ambient temperature (C
a), total
surround by thermal insulation factor (Ci) and semi-enclosed fuse factor (C
c), which
is 0.725) need to be used where appropriate.
Ambient temperature C
a
This is a factor for ambient temperature of the installation where the cables are
run. The tabulated cable current ratings in Appendix 4 of BS 7671 are based
upon a 30°C ambient temperature for general cables and 20°C around ambient
temperature for cables buried in the ground. Tables 4B1 and 4B2 of Appendix 4 of
BS 7671 give the relevant factors to be used, including the new correction factors
for cables buried in the ground. Where there are mixed installation temperatures
in a cable length it is best to use the higher temperature (alternatively, larger cables
can be installed for that portion).
Thermal insulation Ci
A careful application of this factor is required, as many of the cable rating tables
(4D to 4F) already allow for some thermal insulation. This factor (Ci = 0.5) is to be
used where an appropriate cable installation method is not available (533.6.6). It
must be applied to the ‘in free air’ rating of the cable type.
Semi-enclosed fuse factor C
c
This factor, equal to 0.725, should be used where the protective device is a semi-
enclosed (rewirable) fuse.
C 4.3.6 Omission of overload protection
There are examples of circuits or equipment where it is recognized by BS 7671
that overload protection is not required or perhaps not desired.
The first of these is not utilized as much as it could be, and is for circuits with loads
not likely to cause an overload (433.3.1). An example would be a circuit supplying
a fixed water heater, but this regulation applies to many fixed loads. Fault current
protection is still a requirement and must be provided.
The other category of loads for which overload protection need not be provided
is where disconnection could cause danger, such as sprinkler pump supplies, lifting
electromagnets, safety supplies in general (may not apply to all of them) and
others.
It is noted that supply cut-out fuses are allowed to be utilized for overload protection
of the main supply cables (433.3.1).
45
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
C 4.4 Fault protection
C 4.4.1 General and omissions
BS 7671 has new terminology for fault protection. Fault currents now include all
faults, i.e. those between live conductors as well as earth faults. The term ‘short
circuit current’ is not used within Section 434 although it still appears in part 2 –
definitions (it was used in the 16th Edition).
There are two aspects of protection against fault currents: the protection of the
cables, covered in this part, and the protection of and selection of equipment (fault
rating), which is dealt with in Chapter D.
C 4.4.2 Fault protection requirements
For protection against short circuit, the overcurrent device must be able to:
• withstand the short circuit current (device breaking capacity); and
• disconnect sufficiently quickly to prevent damage to the cables.
The fault currents to be considered include faults between line conductors and
earth, line conductor and neutral, and line-to-line conductors. The highest fault
currents will arise with three-phase line conductors shorting together and to
earth.
The BS 7671 requirements for fault protection are summarized in Table C 4.2.

Note 1:  Perhaps one of the most significant regulations here is in relation to achieving compliance with
434.5.2, which states that if overload protection (Ib ≤ In ≤ I
z) is achieved then this will provide fault
protection (435.1).
C
46
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
C 4.4.3 Determination of fault current
The Regulations (434.1) require that the fault current be determined at every
relevant point. For small and medium installations with LV utility supplies, this
is satisfied by determination of the fault currents at the incomer. The DNO will
supply this information and usually quote a maximum fault current of 16 kA. This
is a theoretical maximum that is rarely found in practice. This level of fault will
mean that MCBs (60898 devices, see Chapter D) will need to be rated at 16 kA.
Whilst it is possible to purchase 16 kA devices, they are usually double width and
often more expensive than the 3, 6, 9 or 10 kA devices. A solution here is to measure
the incoming fault currents or loop impedances, and use these values.
For installations with private transformers, calculations are required, and this is
outside the scope of this book. Generally, fault levels of 15–20 kA exist in the close
vicinity of main switchgear, and a careful consideration of MCB fault rating must
be made for local distribution boards.
C 4.4.4 Fault capacity of devices
Table C 4.3 summarizes fault capacities of relevant devices.
For most domestic installations the prospective fault current is unlikely to exceed
6 kA, up to which value the I
and I
values are the same.
cn
cs
The short-circuit capacity of devices to BS EN 60947–2 is specified by the
individual manufacturer.
C 4.4.5 Circuits without overload protection
Where the overcurrent device does not provide overload protection, the cable
size must be checked for short-circuit (thermal) withstand. This confirms that the
circuit energy let through by the protective device does not cause a damaging heat
rise in the cable. The calculation uses the ‘adiabatic’ equation given in Regulation
434.5.2 as follows:

Note 1:  Two rated short-circuit ratings are defined in BS EN 60898 and BS EN 61009: Icn is the rated
short-circuit capacity (marked on the device), Ics is the service short-circuit capacity. The
difference between the two is the condition of the circuit breaker after manufacturer’s testing.
Icn is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely, although the breaker may no
longer be usable.
Ics is the maximum fault current the breaker can interrupt safely without loss of performance.
The Icn value is normally marked on the device in a rectangle, e.g.
6000
For the majority of applications the prospective fault current at the terminals of the circuit-breaker
should not exceed this value.
I is the effective short-circuit current in amperes, due account being taken of the
current limiting effect of the circuit impedances
k is a factor taking account of the resistivity, temperature coefficient and
heat capacity of the conductor material, and the appropriate initial and final
temperatures.
It should be noted that in this application of Equation 5, the disconnection time
should not be taken as 5 s, but is taken from the time-current characteristic for the

2t values that can
be used.
For copper and aluminium cables up to 300 mm2
, k is given in Table C 4.4; the full
list for other materials is found in the Regulations.
The adiabatic equation (Equation 5) can be used to find a tripping time that will
not overheat the cable being used. It is then compared with the actual tripping time
for the protective device at the fault current level found in the device time/current
curves. This can be a little confusing and it can be easier to calculate the minimum
size required using a transposed adiabatic equation as follows:
S =
I √t, noting that S comes out in mm2
.
k
It should be noted that where the initial cable size has been adjusted following a
thermal withstand check, further iterations may be necessary as the new size itself
affects the prospective fault current.
It is worth noting that the factors in Table 43.1 of BS 7671 are based on the circuit
conductor running at its maximum operating temperature. Designers should take
account of this when the adiabatic calculation yields a cable size ‘just over’ a
standard available size. It is suggested that where this is in the order of 5% to
10%, the smaller size be used.
C 4.5 Voltage drop
C 4.5.1 7671 requirements
Section 525 of BS 7671: 2008 contains four regulations specifying that the voltage
at the terminals of equipment is:
• suitable for that specified in the equipment product standard; or
• for equipment without a standard, suitable for safe functioning.
49
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Table C 4.5 Type of supply Appendix12 voltage drop specification.
Voltage drop lighting Voltage drop other
From DNO 3% 5%
Private supply 6% 8%
A new Appendix (12) is included in BS7671: 2008 for consumers’ installations
which, if followed, is ‘deemed to comply’ with voltage drop design requirements
of the Regulations. This is summarized in Table C 4.5.
It is recognized in the body of Section 525 and Appendix 12 that high inrush
currents may cause higher voltage drop levels, and reference to equipment product
standards is made. In essence this does not change the basic requirement that
equipment must work!
C 4.5.2 System design values
For domestic installations, voltage drop is quite simple and rarely needs a design
or further consideration.
In commercial and industrial installations, voltage drop design will depend upon
the nature of the supply. If the supply is to the Electricity Safety, Quality and
Continuity Regulations 2002, the supply voltage can vary between statutory limits
of +10% to –6%. As such, the voltage drops in Table C 4.5 are recommended with
the caveat that voltage can be lower if the equipment standard allows.
For private transformers the subject is more complicated, as the voltage regulation
of the transformer is now under the control of you, the designer. The secondary
terminal voltage of the transformer will largely depend upon the magnitude of
the total load at any instant. Generally it is good practice to simulate the values
of statutory voltage limits found in the Electricity, Safety, Quality and Continuity
Regulations. The current limits are nominal voltage +10% to –6%. Thus for a
large installation, a system of main and sub voltage drops may be required to be
set, to achieve a ‘system’ design. A simple system view of this is given in Figure
C 4.4.
A guide to installation voltage drop limits is 6% with an 8% maximum. Often it
can be useful to apply values in stages in a system, and popular values are 2% to
3% for submains coupled with 4% or 3% for final circuits.

C 4.5.3 Definition and simple calculation of voltage drop
An accurate estimation of the circuit design current is decisive in calculating an
accurate voltage drop. For submains, diversity will need to be considered with a
slightly different approach than when applying diversity for cable sizing. Whilst
short time overload currents will not cause problems to a system, voltage dips
below a certain value may cause equipment to stop or malfunction. Therefore a
more rigorous approach to individual submain diversity is required. An ‘overall’
diversity factor, however, may be equal to that used for the maximum demand
estimate.
The definition of voltage drop is the voltage difference between any two points of
a circuit or conductor, due to the flow of current.
Voltage drop information for installation cables is given in BS 7671 Appendix 4
tables expressed in millivolts for a current of one amp for one metre of the cable.
Hence:
Voltage drop (V) = tabulated voltage drop × design current (A) × length
1000
The tabulated ratings are also denoted as ‘(mV/A/m)’ ratings and the above
equation can be expressed as follows:
v.d. (V) = (mV/A/m) × L × Ib
1000
or can be rearranged to find a limiting circuit length:
Length (m) = permitted v.d. (V) × 1000
(mV/A/m) × Ib
C 4.5.4 Correction for conductor temperature
These equations and the (mV/A/m) values in Appendix 4 of BS 7671 are based
upon fully loaded circuits, a rare circumstance in practice.
The values of (mV/A/m) given in the Appendix 4 tables are at the maximum
conductor operating temperature of, say, 70°C or 90°C, and these temperatures
are only reached when the conductor is carrying its full load. At lower loads,
the temperature and the resistance of the cable are lower. The difference can
be significant – up to 20%. Thus for lightly loaded circuits this can reduce the
tabulated rating (mV/A/m) by up to 20%.

Again, manual calculations can be tedious, and the graphs in Figures C 4.5 and
C 4.6 provide a quick and convenient way of avoiding them. The graphs can be
used to correct tabulated (mV/A/m) values and can be applied to all cables under
16 mm2 and to the tabulated resistive component, (mV/A/m)r, for larger cables.
To use the graphs, select an Ib/I
n line, and find the reduction factor F at the
appropriate installation ambient temperature and a corresponding reduction factor.
This factor is multiplied by either the tabulated (mV/A/m) value for cables up to
16 mm2 or by the resistive (mV/A/m)r component for cables of 25 mm2 and over.
C 4.5.5 Correction for load power factor and temperature
For larger cables above 25 mm2 where the load power factor is known, a more
accurate estimation can be made of voltage drop allowing slightly greater cable

length or perhaps reduced size in marginal cases. The voltage drop is calculated
using the formula:
Voltage drop =
+ sin f (mV/A/m)x]
where
(mV/A/m)r is the tabulated value of resistive element of voltage drop in mV
per amp per metre from the cable rating tables of Appendix 4 of BS 7671
(mV/A/m)x is the tabulated value of inductive element of voltage drop in mV
per amp per metre from the cable rating tables of Appendix 4
f is the power factor of the load
For cables of 25 mm2 and greater, the voltage drop is given both as an impedance
(mV/A/m)z and as a complex impedance with a resistive element (mV/A/m)r
and
inductive element (mV/A/m)x
as follows:
(mV/A/m)z
= √(mV/A/m)r
2 + (mV/A/m)x

Example calculations are provided in Appendix 10.
C 4.6 Disconnection and electric shock
C 4.6.1 Introduction and protective measures
A significant change for BS 7671: 2008 is the introduction of new terminology
within the new Chapter 41. The previously very familiar terms ‘direct contact’ and
‘indirect contact’ are replaced by the terms ‘basic protection’ and ‘fault protection’
respectively; these terms in themselves introduce no technical changes.
As well as terminology changes, the whole of Chapter 41 has been revised. It is
important to become familiar with the structure of the chapter, and this is depicted
in Figure C 4.7.
It can be seen that ‘basic protection’ measures have been shunted to the end of
the chapter. This is sensible, as almost without exception we do not consider these;
they are so fundamental as to be ‘automatically’ included. The ‘basic protection’
protective measure is achieved by selecting equipment complying with relevant
product standards.
The new terms ‘basic protection’ and ‘fault protection’ are illustrated in
Figure C 4.8.

The second structural arrangement of Chapter 41 to note is that the measures
other than automatic disconnection or ‘other measures’, i.e. Obstacles and Out of
Reach (417), Non-conducting Locations (418) and Earth-free Local Equipotential
Bonding (418.2) have been relegated to the rear of the chapter. As these methods
are rarely used they have been discussed in Appendix 13.
C 4.6.2 Automatic disconnection of supply
The ‘protective measure – automatic disconnection of supply’ is the standard
method used in most applications and almost by default. This measure makes up
the bulk of Chapter 41 totalling some 40 regulations.
Although the whole of Chapter 41 has been revised, highlights of automatic
disconnection include reduced disconnection times (compared with the 16th
Edition) and an increased use of RCDs, both explained in this part of the book.
Chapter 41 first sets down the main requirements for automatic disconnection,
followed by specifics for TN, TT and IT systems.
To comply with the ‘protective measure’, the following are required:
1 basic protection; and
2 protective earthing and protective equipotential bonding (see Chapter E);
and
3 automatic disconnection in the event of a fault.
Automatic disconnection requires disconnection within the time given by Table
41.1 of BS 7671. For nominal line-to-earth voltages U0 of 230 V, as in the UK, the
requirements are given in Table C 4.6.

Z
s is the total earth fault loop impedance (ELI) in ohms of the fault loop,

fault Z 1 and the protective conductor within the installation Z 2 between the

e + (Z 1 + Z 2)
Earth fault loop impedance calculations conventionally assume a fault of negligible
impedance.
Figures C 4.9 and C 4.10 show the path of earth fault current for TN-C-S and TT
systems and the components that make up the impedance of the earth fault loop.
For TT systems Z
s includes the resistance of the installation cables (Z 1 and Z 2), the
installation earth electrode (Z
a), the supply distribution cable and the supply earth
electrode (Z d).
Maximum design earth fault loop impedance values for common devices are given
in Tables 41.2, 41.3, 41.4 of BS 7671: 2008 and are reproduced in Appendix 3
of this book.
Within this book, in order to distinguish the BS 7671 tabulated design earth fault
loop impedance values from measured values, design earth fault loop impedance
values have been given the symbol Z 41 (note: this symbol does not appear in BS
7671).

Therefore, to achieve the required disconnection times:

Z 41 > Z

where
Z 41 is the design ELI from Chapter 41
Z
s is the total earth fault loop impedance
Z

For conductor sizes 16 mm2 and less, reactance is not a factor and resistance can
be used, and the equation becomes:
Z 41 > Z
e + (R1 + R2)
where
R1 is the resistance of the line conductor, up to the point of the fault
R2 is the resistance of the protective conductor.
An alternative way of expressing this is by calculating the maximum length of a
circuit and using the following formula:
L ≤
Z 41 – Z
e
R1 + R2
where
R1 is the resistance in ohms per metre of the line conductor
R2 is the resistance in ohms per metre of the protective conductor
Z
e, the impedance of the supply, is either measured, determined from the supply
company, or if domestic can be assumed to be as in Table C 4.7.

C 4.6.3 TT installations
A disconnection time of 0.2 s for TT installations has been introduced in the 17th
Edition. This makes the use of an RCD or circuit breaker with a residual element
virtually essential.
For most installations, the installation earth electrode value Z
a (see Figure C 4.10)
is large compared with the other factors contributing to earth fault loop impedance
(supply and installation cables and supply earthing, Z d). For simplicity, therefore,
the following formula is used:
Z
a
< Z 41 RCD
where Z 41 RCD is the maximum value of loop impedance from Table C 4.8.
When an RCD is used for shock protection it is necessary to provide short circuit
protection between line conductors and neutral by an overcurrent device.

1 An earth electrode value of greater than 200 W is considered by some to be unstable; others use a
figure of 100 W. However, for single vertical rod electrodes, depth is an important factor and a 2.4 m deep
electrode with initial resistance of, say, 300 W will be more stable than a shallow 1.2 m rod with an initial
resistance of, say, 100 W. Thus the effects of freezing and drying out can be all but eliminated in the UK by
installing 2.4 m deep electrodes.

C 4.6.4 ELI adjustment
The design values of maximum earth fault loop impedance (ELI) given in BS
7671 Tables 41.2, 41.3 and 41.4 cannot be directly compared to measured values.
Measured values of ELI need to be adjusted to take account of the fact that when
measured they are not at maximum operating temperature. While this point is
discussed in Chapter F of this book, the necessary compensation step often gets
missed; the design engineer thinks the tester will do a compensation and vice
versa.
A new appendix, Appendix 14, has been included in the 17th Edition, and this
suggests a compensation value of 0.8 applied as follows:
Z measured ≤ 0.8 Z 41
Although this guidance and the values in BS 7671 Tables 41.2, 41.3 and 41.4 set
figures for maximum ELI, we should not get paranoid if the odd circuit slightly
exceeds these values.
C 4.6.5 Irrelevant ELI specification
A common source of misunderstanding is that of either specifying or measuring
values of ELI where the circuit also has an RCD fitted. ELI measurement under
these circumstances is a futile exercise. The circuit will have been checked for
continuity, and this is all that is needed together with, of course, functional checks
of the RCD. This criterion satisfies requirements for automatic disconnection. The
subject is somewhat confused by the inclusion of RCBOs in BS 7671 Table 41.3
and for clarification, circuits with RCBOs do not need to meet the specified ELI
values.
Functional checks for RCDs are covered in Chapter F.
C 4.6.6 RCD supplementary protection
A completely new requirement in Chapter 41 is Regulation 411.3.3, which specifies
RCDs for socket-outlet circuits intended for use by ordinary persons.
A point to stress here is that the ‘additional protection’ is not optional; it is now a
fundamental requirement of Chapter 41.
The wording of this regulation is reproduced below, and guidance on its
interpretation is given under the selection and erection part of RCDs, Section
D 7.1.
63
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
411.3.3 Additional Protection
In a.c. systems, additional protection by means of an RCD in accordance
with Regulation 415.1 shall be provided for:
(i) socket-outlets with a rated current not exceeding 20 A that are for use by
ordinary persons and are intended for general use, and
(ii) mobile equipment with a current rating not exceeding 32 A for use
outdoors.
An exception is permitted for:
(a) socket-outlets for use under the supervision of skilled or instructed
persons, e.g. in some commercial or industrial locations, or
(b) a specific labelled or otherwise suitably identified socket-outlet provided
for connection of a particular item of equipment.
Note 1: See also Regulations 314.1(iv) and 531.2.4 concerning the avoidance
of unwanted tripping.
Note 2: The requirements of Regulation 411.3.3 do not apply to FELV
systems according to Regulation 411.7 or reduced low voltage systems
according to Regulation 411.8.
In the context of this Regulation, RCD is a 30 mA RCD.
C 5 Submains
C 5.1 Diversity
Getting a design that achieves function, economics and future capacity is important
for most installations and in achieving this an accurate estimate of design current is
key. General notes on diversity and load profiles were given in Section C 3.
C 5.2 Distribution circuit (submain) selection
Distribution circuits are normally selected from the following cables and wiring
systems:

• single insulated cables in trunking or conduit;
• steel wire armoured cables;
• mineral insulated cables.
The most suitable can be selected with assistance from Table C 5.1, which generally
highlights the particular advantages and disadvantages of the systems. Of course,
regional material and labour costs will have to be factored into this decision of
wiring system.
C 5.3 Armouring as a cpc
Software design packages may propose that a supplementary protective conductor
be run in parallel with an armoured cable. This is usually proposed to reduce the
loop impedance such that disconnection will occur within the required five seconds.
If possible, designers should manually check the calculation at this point.
The armouring of cables can and should be used as a protective conductor.
All protective conductors are required either to:
• comply with the adiabatic equation of Regulation 543.1.3,
S = √I
2t
k
, or
• meet the cross-sectional area requirements of Table 54.7.
65
C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The calculated size virtually always produces a smaller conductor size (see Chapter
E).
In 2007, the ECA commissioned the Electrical Research Association (ERA) to carry
out an investigation into the merits or not of running additional cpcs externally to
armoured cables.
The report included a comparison of the fault current withstand of the armour of
cables to BS 5467, using the k values given in Chapter 54 of BS 7671. It showed
that for all cables except 120 mm2 and 400 mm2 2-core cables, the fault current-
withstand of the armour was greater than the fault current required to operate a
BS 88 fuse within 5 s. The 120 mm2 cable was within a few per cent of passing,
and should be used unless it is intended to run the cable at full current-carrying
capacity.
Also, calculation of the current sharing between the armour and an external cpc
showed that if a small external cpc was run in parallel with the armour of a large
cable there is a risk that the fault current withstand of the external cpc will be
exceeded. Because of this it is recommended that the cross-sectional area of the
external cpc should not be less than a quarter of that of the line conductors.
More details of the findings from this report are discussed in Chapter E, Section
E5, and a full copy of the report is included in Appendix 16.
The following guidance is recommended:
• Use all armoured cables as a cpc without the need for a thermal withstand
check with the exception of 400 mm2 2-core.
Note: The 120 mm2 cable was within a few per cent of the size required
(required I
2t – 33 062 500, actual 33 800 000 after 5 s) and should be used
without calculation unless it is intended to run the cable at full current-carrying
capacity. It is very difficult to load a cable of this size at its full current-carrying
capacity for a continuously long period.
• Where calculation software specifies external cpcs for ELI reduction, use a
cpc size of at least 25% of the phase size (perhaps after manually checking
calculations).
• Manually check ELI calculations where they specify a small external cable
cpc.

C 6 Discrimination co-ordination
C 6.1 Principles and system co-ordination
Section 536 of BS 7671: 2008 details requirements for protective device
co-ordination. An overall ‘system’ design view has to be taken on discrimination
and co-ordination as otherwise this can lead to uneconomic schemes.
For some installations, depending upon the number of protective devices between
final circuit and incomer protection, it may be an expensive luxury to design for full
discrimination. Consider Figure C 6.1, which illustrates this point; a final circuit
distribution board has a socket outlet protected by a 32 A circuit breaker.
As can be seen, by using a 2:1 discrimination rule to achieve full discrimination, a
2000 A main protective device is required and we have not considered any loads!
This demonstrates that, for many installations, whole system discrimination is not
justified unless there are life-critical constraints.
Regulation 536.1 states that discrimination should be considered to prevent danger
and where required for proper functioning of the installation. Chapter 36 gives an
example of life-support systems where discrimination should be considered.
There is a fair bit of judgement to be made. Take Figure C 6.1 again – let’s say the
final circuit board was for a multi-million pound dealer unit. It would be reasonable
for circuit breaker A to discriminate with circuit breaker B, but the discrimination
between circuit breakers C and D may still be regarded as a luxury. We all know
that despite the turnover of the client, there would be a limit to what they would
pay for the electrical installation.

There are many options and combinations that can assist; for example, in Figure
C 6.1 the final circuit breaker (A) could be 16 or 20 A, or circuit breaker C may
be omitted.
In order to carry out an accurate discrimination study, fault current magnitudes
are required at every protective device position.

68
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
C 6.2 Fuse-to-fuse discrimination
Fuses are relatively simple to consider when establishing discrimination
co-ordination. As a rule of thumb, an upstream circuit breaker will always
discriminate with a downstream fuse of half its rating. This applies for all currents
of both overload magnitude and for fault currents. Fuses have characteristics
described as follows:
• Pre-arcing I
2t is the energy required to take the fuse element to the point where
it starts to melt.
• Total operating I
2t is the total energy until the arc is quenched.
This information is widely available from product standards, manufacturers and is
included in Appendix 5 of this book. Discrimination is achieved if the pre-arcing
I
2t of the upstream device is less than the total operating I
2t of the downstream
device; this is illustrated for some common BS 88 fuses in Figure C 6.2.

C 6.3 C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
It can be seen that by studying the I
2t characteristics that the 80 A fuse discriminates
with the 125 A fuse (but not with the 100 A fuse).
Fuses to BS 88 and BS 1361 have relatively very high fault ratings and will be able
to interrupt all short circuit currents in the installation, with no need for cascading
(see Section C 6.3).
Circuit breaker to circuit breaker discrimination
Unlike fuses, circuit breakers cannot always rely on the upstream/downstream
ratio of 2:1 for guaranteed discrimination. The 2:1 ratio generally holds true
for the thermal trip mechanism but does not always apply to the magnetic trip
mechanism (see D5 for explanation of mechanisms).
The normal method of manual co-ordination is by plotting the relevant protective
device characteristics onto the same time-current graph paper. Due to scaling this
is carried out on log-log paper; the graph in Figure C 6.3 shows two circuit breakers
and the ‘zone’ where discrimination may not be achieved.

Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
The zone indicated in Figure C 6.3 indicates an area where discrimination can
only be achieved by carrying out tests and thus only manufacturers can confirm
discrimination between circuit breakers in this zone.
Discrimination in this area is a subject vaguely addressed by some manufacturers
and, for critical applications mentioned in C 6.1, confirmation by the manufacturer
is strongly recommended.
Sometimes this subject is confused with cascading, a circumstance where
downstream circuit breakers are ‘backed-up’ by circuit breakers. This technique
should not be a substitute for a system discrimination co-ordination. Where
cascading is used, the upstream breaker must have sufficient short-circuit breaking
capacity to interrupt the fault, and the downstream breaker must be able to handle
the through fault currents sufficiently long enough for the upstream breaker to
operate.
C 6.4 Circuit breaker to fuse discrimination
At certain fault levels, fuses operate quicker than circuit breakers. Although now
always readily available, the use of fuses is often to assist with achieving a system
discrimination scheme. Figure C 6.4 shows circuit breaker and fuse characteristics
and indicates the faster operating time at high fault currents (no values have been
put on the figure as this is a general trend).
The principle outlined in Figure C 6.4 is the same as used for back-up protection,
where a downstream circuit breaker is not rated for the prospective fault current
at the point where it is installed. Take point X in the figure; larger fault currents
will be interrupted by the fuse, smaller fault currents will be interrupted by the
circuit breaker. Thus point X should be at a current less than the fault rating of
the circuit breaker. Manufacturers’ data should be considered in co-ordinating for
back-up protection.

C 7 Parallel cables
C 7.1 General and 7671 requirements
The use of parallel cables is often made for reasons of cost as, for a given current, two
or more cables run in parallel may be more economic than a single larger one.
The other reason to use two or more cables in parallel is for ease of running and
the logistics of termination. Sometimes switchgear may simply not have the space
in the termination area for a single cable over a certain size.
BS 7671 requirements for cables run in parallel are summarized in Table C 7.1.

C
72
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
It should be noted that ring circuits are not considered to be parallel cables.
The requirements of Table C 7.1 and hence the Regulations are satisfied by
selecting cables of exactly the same type, construction and installation, in which
case the total current-carrying capacity is the sum of the individual current-
carrying capacities.
It should be noted that grouping factors are applicable to parallel cables.
C 7.2 Unequal current sharing
The general rules, summarized in Table C 7.1, apply to most applications for
cables run in parallel with equal impedance. This is achieved if all the factors
that affect the current-carrying capacity of the cables are the same, i.e. type,
length, construction and installation method. It is assumed by this criterion that
the impedances will be within 10% of each other and current sharing is taken to
be equal.
Where this is not the case, it is possible to calculate and design the unequal current
sharing based upon the different impedances, and methods for this are included
in Appendix 10 of BS 7671: 2008. Discussion of this is outside the scope of this
book.
C 8 Harmonics
C 8.1 Requirements
BS 7671: 2008 primarily concerns itself with harmonics in respect of appropriate
sizing of the neutral conductor, and the requirements are summarized in Table C

C 8.2 Harmonic assessment
Coupled with Regulation 523.6.3, BS 7671: 2008 provides an informative Appendix
(11) on cable de-rating for installations with high harmonic currents.
Most modern installations contain equipment that causes harmonic currents;
for example, equipment with switched mode power supplies found in personal
computers, photocopiers, printers, fluorescent lighting and motor drives. The
summation of these harmonic currents can cause an overload in the neutral
conductor. Table C 8.2, extracted from Appendix 11 of BS 7671, provides
de-rating factors for balanced three-phase loads and should be applied to 4- and
5-core cables.
It can be seen that a de-rating factor of 0.86 will cover neutral undersizing
and perhaps may be used for loads like micro and small data centres and
communications rooms. This de-rating should be used in conjunction with the
general cable sizing philosophy given in Sections C 3 and C 4.
Appendix 11 of BS 7671: 2008 gives further methods for harmonic de-rating
factors for higher harmonic frequencies, but these are outside the scope of this
book.
C 9 Standard final circuit designs
C 9.1 Introduction and scope
This section provides ‘standard’ designs for some common final circuits. The
designs provide circuit type, protective device and most importantly a maximum
circuit length. Many of us use these standard designs, as it is time-consuming to
C
74
Circuitry and Related Parts of BS 7671: 2008
design every final circuit from first principles. Standard circuit designs are usually
used for common circuits, particularly domestic circuits.
The designs in this Section C 9.3 can be used in commercial and industrial
installation designs for final circuits where the eath fault loop impedance at the
local distribution board does not exceed the standard values given below.
The tables have been calculated using particular parameters as follows:
External earth fault loop impedances
Those used by the UK supply industry are as follows:
• 0.35 Ω for PME supplies;
• 0.80 Ω for TN-S supplies;
• 21 Ω for TT supplies.
Where RCDs are used, the tables in this section have been calculated so that the earth
fault loop impedance values comply with the limiting values for overcurrent devices
in Chapter 41. This gives maximum lengths, which are generally recommended,
but considerably longer lengths are possible.
Cable types and installation methods
The standard circuit tables have assumed flat twin and earth cable to BS 6400 with
reduced cpc size and installed as Table 4A2 of BS 7671 with current rating taken
from Table 4D5 of BS 7671 (see Table C 9.1):

100, 101 and 102) show a significantly better current rating as compared with the
‘totally surrounded method’ (method 103).

C 9.3 All-purpose standard final circuits
The following tables are based on a voltage drop of 5%. Circuits are suitable for
the installation reference methods listed in the tables. Voltage drop limitations are
calculated for the most onerous installation reference method listed for the cable/
overcurrent device combination. The load assumed is the rating of the overcurrent
device.
Some values of maximum length in the tables have the notation(s), indicating that
the length is limited by earth fault loop impedance. If you have an external loop
impedance lower that that used in the table then longer lengths are possible.

C 10 RCDs and circuitry
C 10.1 Introduction, increased use of RCDs
Chapter D discusses the selection of RCDs and their increased specification in BS
7671: 2008 compared with previous editions. The increased use of RCDs includes
the following:
• All socket-outlet circuits accessible to ordinary or non-instructed persons*
(411.3.3).
• All circuits within a bathroom (701.411.3.3).
• Concealed cables either less than 50 mm deep, in installations not intended to
be under the supervision of a skilled or instructed person*, not mechanically
protected or protected by earthed metal and not run in the ‘safe zones’ *.
• Concealed cables within metal partitions, in installations not intended to be
under the supervision of a skilled or instructed person*, not mechanically
protected or protected by earthed metal and accessible to ordinary or non-
instructed persons*.

C 10.2 C
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• Generally where disconnection times cannot be achieved with an overcurrent
device.
• Most TT installations, usually required to achieve a disconnection time of
0.2 s.
• Other special locations, including swimming pools and caravan parks.
*The subject of providing RCDs for ordinary persons is covered in D 7.1, which
should be read in conjunction with this section. They are now required for most
domestic socket-outlet circuits as well as some commercial and industrial socket-
outlet circuits, and this section of the book details how to arrange the circuitry
aspects of RCDs in order to maintain compliance with the Regulations.
Consumer unit arrangements for RCDs
Every installation shall be divided into circuits as necessary to:
• avoid hazards and minimize inconvenience in the event of a fault;
• facilitate safe inspection, testing and maintenance;
• take account of danger that may arise from circuit failure such as a lighting
circuit;
• reduce the possibility of unwanted tripping of RCDs, due to excessive protective
conductor currents produced by equipment in normal operation;
• mitigate the effects of electromagnetic interference; and
• prevent the indirect energizing of a circuit intended to be isolated.
There are various ways of arranging RCDs in consumer units; an obvious but
expensive option is to use RCBOs for every circuit. Short of this, the figures in this
section show some useful arrangements.
Figure C 10.1 shows a split load consumer unit with single 30 mA RCD. This
would be used in both TN-S and TN-C-S systems and provide compliance with
the ‘Additional Protection’ requirements of Chapter 41.
Figure C 10.2 shows an installation wholly protected with RCDs, a 100 mA main
switch RCD incorporating a time delay and a secondary 30 mA RCD. This is
suitable for TN-S and TN-C-S installations, and TT installations (with an insulated
consumer unit).

C 11 Ring and radial final circuits
C 11.1 Introduction
BS 7671: 2008 provides some basic guidance on ring and radial final circuits. This
information is included within Appendix 15 of BS 7671: 2008, the diagrams of
which are reproduced in this section with kind permission of the IET.
C 11.2 Ring final circuits
Rings must comply with Regulation 433.1.4, which is as follows:
433.1.4 Accessories to BS 1363 may be supplied through a ring final circuit,
with or without unfused spurs, protected by a 30 A or 32 A protective device
complying with BS 88–2.2, BS 88–6, BS 1361, BS 3036, BS EN 60898,
BS EN 60947–2 or BS EN 61009–1 (RCBO). The circuit shall be wired
with copper conductors having line and neutral conductors with a minimum
cross-sectional area of 2.5 mm2 except for two-core mineral insulated cables
complying with BS EN 60702–1, for which the minimum cross-sectional area
is 1.5 mm2. Such circuits are deemed to meet the requirements of Regulation
433.1.1 if the current-carrying capacity (I
z) of the cable is not less than 20 A
and if, under the intended conditions of use, the load current in any part of
the circuit is unlikely to exceed for long periods the current-carrying capacity
(I
z) of the cable.
Recommendations on how to achieve this are as follows, noting that this advice
may differ from that in Appendix 15 of BS767: 2008:
• For commercial and industrial installations radials are preferred.
• Large fixed loads (2 kW and above) should not be connected near the ‘ends’ of
a 32 A ring.
• Kitchen appliances should preferably be supplied via dedicated radials or
rings.
Figure C 11.1 is based upon that in Appendix 15 of BS 7671: 2008.

Selection and Erection – Equipment
D 1 Introduction and fundamentals
This chapter on selection and erection of equipment discusses and provides
guidance and solutions on what essentially is an equipment area of BS 7671: 2008,
and includes a sizeable amount of the Regulations. Consistent with the general
philosophy of this book, all areas are amply covered with particular practical
guidance on more difficult or contentious areas.
The selection of equipment generally is a very important aspect for the designer,
but often understated is that the installer selects equipment. In this case the installer
is carrying out part-design, and installers should obtain selection advice from their
designer unless contracted to do otherwise.
The term equipment, as the BS 7671 definition makes clear, relates to all equipment
to be utilized in an electrical installation. So as to be clear as to what is included, the
BS 7671 definition of electrical equipment is repeated in the box below.
Electrical equipment (abbr: equipment). Any item for such purposes as generation,
conversion, transmission, distribution or utilization of electrical energy, such as machines,
transformers, apparatus, measuring instruments, protective devices, wiring systems,
accessories, appliances and luminaires.
Fundamental requirements for selecting all equipment
It is important to note that the selection and erection requirements of the 17th
Edition do not in general repeat requirements within the product standards to
which the equipment is made. Instead, BS 7671 addresses equipment so far as
selection and equipment within the installation is concerned (Regulation 113.1).
When selecting equipment, the following must be considered:
91
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• compliance with the appropriate product standards;
• suitability for the anticipated operational conditions;
• suitability for the anticipated external influences;
• provision for adequate accessibility for maintenance.
D 2 Compliance with Standards
One of the most fundamental rules of the 17th Edition is that equipment shall
comply with an acceptable and current equipment Standard. Most equipment will
have a specific British Standard or BS EN written for it, and these standards would
need to be used for specifying or selecting equipment.
However, for many reasons, it may not be possible or desirable to select equipment
to an appropriate BS or BS EN Standard, and in these cases alternatives are
permissible. In the author’s experience this route is not uncommon as often non-
European equipment is more viable; an example here is the prefabricated wiring
systems made to IEC or USA Standards. In cases such as this there are two routes
to compliance and the flow diagram below provides some further guidance.
Firstly, equipment to a foreign national Standard which is based on the
corresponding IEC Standard may be used provided that, as the 17th Edition
requires: ‘the designer confirms that it provides at least the same degree of safety
as equivalent British Standard equipment’. In practice this exercise will usually
approach the impossible and, in many cases, a sensible view has to be taken. Some
will find this judgement to be unacceptable but it is your responsibility, if you are
the designer; you may wish to use only BS EN equipment.
Another route applies where you wish to use equipment not covered by a Standard,
or where it is used outside of scope, and here the designer must confirm its safety
to the 17th Edition. This option is at least achievable.
A diagram of how to select a product standard in relation to Section 511 is given
in Figure D 2.1.
It should now be obvious that selection of equipment is very much dependent upon
knowledge of the equipment Standards and, from this aspect, the BSI website is
invaluable.
This book includes a list of some relevant BS and BS EN standards in
Appendix 1.

D 3 Identification of conductors
Introduction
Harmonized cable colours were introduced into BS 7671 in the 2004 Amendment,
and transitional arrangements were made. The 17th Edition makes no changes
to the regulations on cable identification or to Appendix 7 of BS 7671, which
provides details of interfaces with existing installations.
93
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
D 3.1 Principle of required identification (514.3.1)
It is most important to understand the principle behind the drafting of the 17th
Edition in respect of cable identification. Cable cores shall be identifiable at their
terminations either by colour or by alphanumeric characters. While this has not
changed from the 16th Edition it is worth discussing the principles.
It is noted that cores should preferably be identifiable throughout their length. For
many applications coloured cables, either single- or multicore, will be used and
these cables are obviously identified throughout their length. However, in many
other applications installers will need to make use of this Regulation (514.3.1) for
overmarking at terminations. The principles and applications of identification are
now discussed with the use of diagrams.
Figure D 3.1 shows the principle of identification where colours are used, i.e.
marking by colour at all terminations and preferably throughout the length.
In Figure D 3.1 marking throughout the length is not used and single core cables
have been used. It should be noted that the colour of the cables originally used is
not important and overmarking by tape or similar takes precedence.
Building on this principle, Figure D 3.2 shows the principle of identification where
alphanumeric identification is used.
It is perhaps more obvious now that marking throughout the length is not necessary.
It should be noted that the colour of the cables originally used is not important
and overmarking takes precedence. This principle holds whatever the colour of
cores of the original cable, and applies at terminations by coloured tapes or by
characters.

Figure D 3.2 Principle of identification by characters.
In summary, an important principle is established in that, wherever marking at
terminations by either tapes, lettering or numbering is used, the original cable
colours must be ignored; this can be against your gut feeling but you must get used
to it!
Common examples and applications where identification is only practised at
terminations include the following:
• Multicore cables with more than five cores.
• MICC cables.
• Control applications wired in single-core conductors.
• Applications where coloured cable is not available, including connections to
large generators or transformers, where often only black cable is available.
It should now be established that installers may wish to use any single cable colour,
or combination of colours, and overmark at terminations, and this is not considered
a lesser option. For green-and-yellow conductors in multicore cables, overmarking
in another colour at terminations is permitted. Overmarking at terminations is
prohibited for single-core green-and-yellow conductors.
The general principles are now discussed further and some applications are
included.
D 3.2 Identification by colour
Where colour is used to comply with the method of identification, Table 51 from
BS 7671: 2008 gives the colour options.

Following the principles of the Regulations, it should be stressed that the
alphanumeric column was added to Table 51 for reference and if the colour option
is used, these are not required.

96
Selection and Erection – Equipment
Control circuits, ELV and other applications
It should be noted that in the last part of Table 51 ‘Control circuits, ELV and
other applications’ the use of other cable colours is allowed for these particular
applications. This can be for any application where the general standard power
colours are not preferred. An example of where this would be used would be a
lock-stop button control cable, where it is desired to use, say, violet as a colour. It
should be noted that additional termination marking (by colour or characters)
would not be necessary (the information relating to violet as a colour for the lock-
stop cable would normally be contained on schedules or schematic diagrams).
D 3.3 Identification by marking
Colour identification does not have to be used, and of course sometimes cannot
be used, for example when using MICC cables. In these cases, or where the
designer or installer simply does not prefer colour, identification by marking at
terminations is used. Section 514 of BS 7671: 2008 allows you the flexibility to
select an identification system that works for you and the application.
This may either be the alphanumeric identification of Table 51 or can be by
numbering (514.5.4). Numbering may be the preferred method of identification;
for example, multicore armoured termination kits. Take a 27-core armoured cable.
The cores are numbered from 0 to 26; in the installation, a number of these may
be used for neutrals and others used for earths (514.5.4 states that the number 0
should be used for the neutral). They are all coloured black. Normally, to satisfy
other parts of BS 7671, a suitable wiring diagram or equivalent will be required,
indicating the use of the numbers (unless there is no possibility of confusion).
D 3.4 Additions and alterations – identification
Where pre-2004 harmonized cable colours (generally red, yellow, blue and black)
and harmonized colours (generally brown, black, grey and blue) are used in the
same installation, the following label must be applied at the relevant distribution
boards or items of switchgear as appropriate.
CAUTION: This installation has wiring colours to two versions of BS 7671. Great
care should be taken before undertaking extension, alteration or repair that all conductors are
correctly identified.
It should be noted that this label need not be applied at all other points on circuits,
only at the point of the circuits most likely to be used for isolation in the future,
most commonly the distribution boards or items of switchgear.
97
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
D 3.5 Interface marking
When harmonized cable colours were introduced into BS 7671 in the 2004
Amendment, a new Appendix 7 was included detailing best practice for marking
between pre-harmonized and harmonized colours. This appendix is reproduced
in the 17th Edition.
The 17th Edition requires that termination overmarking is applied ‘except where
there is no possibility of confusion’ at interfaces (the interface is the joint between
pre-harmonized and harmonized).
In practice, the installer will need to learn the principle and apply it accordingly,
but no marking is required for most single-phase correctly coloured interfaces – see
Figure D 3.3.
For three-phase applications, Appendix 7 of BS 7671 suggests applying L1, L2,
L3 and N at interfaces, again, where there is no possibility of confusion. The
requirements are illustrated for some typical three-phase installation interfaces.
There are examples when interface marking will not be required, but the
decision is for the installer, and if you are uncomfortable with interpretation it is
recommended that you always apply the interface marking. However, there are of
course applications where interface marking is not required, as per the Figure D
3.4.
D 3.6 d.c. identification
d.c. colour or alphanumeric identification is given in Table 51 within the 17th
Edition, and both the colours and alphanumeric specified have caused some
heartache since they were introduced in the 2004 Amendment. Many engineers feel
that the d.c. colours specified in the 17th Edition are inappropriate; this is a classic
area where, if it is felt that existing practice of colours is less confusing, a departure
is made with an appropriate note recorded on the completion certificate.

D 4 EMC and prevention of mutual detrimental influences
D 4.1 Introduction
The Wiring Regulations have for a number of years included basic regulations
for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), regulations about separating system
voltages and also regulations about the rather cumbersome title of ‘preventing
mutual detrimental influences’. These topics are all discussed in this section as
many of the recommendations overlap.
BS 7671: 2008 has a number of regulations to take note of as follows:
• Section 528 – proximity to other cables, equipment.
• Part 515 EMC.
Let’s first look at proximity; Regulation 528.2 requires that ELV and LV circuits
shall not be in the same containment unless insulated for the highest voltage
present. This applies to cables on cable tray as well as within conduit, trunking and
ducting. Of course, this insulation requirement is not required where compartments
physically separate the cables.
D 4.2 EMC directive and BS 7671
Previously, the EMC directive did not specifically mention installations, but the
recent revision to the directive now states installations are not exempt from the
legislation. This section provides brief guidance on complying with the EMC
directive and EMC requirements of BS 7671: 2008.
The directive and official guidance indicates that best practice is followed, and
cites HD 60384, the European harmonization document upon which BS 7671:
2008 is based. Regulation 515.3 states that equipment shall be chosen with suitable
immunity and emission levels.
The EMC directive Regulations and various guidance documents can be found
on the DTI website, and this also provides links for supporting informative EMC
documents as well as a link to the EU Commission website. All main documents
and guides on these sites were, at the time of writing, free of charge.
So, what is the impact and what advice can be provided to installation designers
and installers? Three key points of action are required:
101
D
D 4.3 D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
1 Equipment should preferably be to BS EN standards. Immunity and emission
are written into standards and, irrespective of this, manufacturers have an
obligation to manufacture to the EU EMC levels. If you need to use equipment
to a different standard it is a good idea to obtain confirmation that equivalent
immunity and emission has been achieved. It is important to note that it is the
EU retailer who has the duty to confirm this (e.g. the importer). This is not
always as difficult as it sounds, as Standards like the USA’s FCC rules are both
stringent and well documented.
2 Design and install circuits and equipment to ‘best practice’. This means to BS
7671 and other recommended guides. At the time of writing, a new section
(444) was being drafted by the Wiring Regulations committee and is likely to
include new regulations and some guidance on this subject.
3 Formalize documentation. It is perhaps even more important now to formalize
the storage of the project’s technical design and installation information.
By completing these three actions, designers and installers will have fulfilled their
duties under the EMC directive as well as BS 7671: 2008.
EMC cable separation – power, IT, data and control cables
General
Firstly it must be stated that the majority of power installations installed to BS
7671 will exhibit no EMC problems between the power system and ‘sensitive’ data
type installation. Indeed, it is interesting to note that many data IT installation
EMC problems have been discovered to be infringements of BS 7671, particularly
poor earthing.
In spite of this, the following guidance is recommended where ‘sensitive’
equipment is installed (‘sensitive’ equipment means IT data and communications
equipment). Some of the recommendations will have to be balanced against cost
and performance.
When the requirements for the segregation of sensitive equipment and cables are
being considered for an installation, more design and installation information can
be found in the series of Standards BS EN 50310, BS EN 50173 and BS EN 50174
Part 1–3.
Recommendations – cable separation for sensitive equipment
The following optional solutions may be considered to mitigate the effects of EMC
on sensitive equipment:
102
Selection and Erection – Equipment
• separate power transformers as Figure D 4.1;
• size neutral for unbalanced load and triple harmonic currents1;
• balance loads;
• in extreme cases, oversizing the power transformer to lower the source
impedance.

D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The following points are also recommended to prevent the electricity distribution
systems adversely influencing sensitive equipment. There will be practical limits to
most of the options, and compromises will often be necessary:
1 A physical distance-based separation between potential sources of interference,
e.g. lifts, power transformers, variable speed drives, high current busbars or
HV equipment.
2 Metal pipes such as water, gas, heating and cables should enter the building at
the same location as the electrical power cable and be connected to the main
equipotential bonding system at this point.
3 A common route through the building for power and signal cables will avoid
large inductive loops formed by different cabling systems.
4 The necessary separation between power and information technology cables
by distance or by screening should be provided. Separation distances are found
in Table D 4.1.
5 Power and information technology cables should cross over at right angles.
6 Power cabling systems that use single-core conductors should ideally be
enclosed in earthed metallic enclosures or conduits.
The separation distances given in Table D 4.1 are for backbone cabling from end
to end. However, for horizontal cabling where the final circuit length is less than
35 metres no separation is required in the case of screened cabling.

D 4.4 Cable management and EMC
Some metallic cable management products offer an improved protection from
electromagnetic emissions (EMI). Plastic cable management systems can also offer
some protection but are only recommended where the system has a low emission
level, or where optical fibre cabling is used.
Figure D 4.3 illustrates recommended cable layouts within cable management
products.
Where metallic system components are used, the shape (flat, U-shape, tube, etc.)
will determine the characteristic impedance of the cable management system.
Enclosed shapes, by reducing the common mode coupling, offer the best profile.

D 5 Wiring systems
D 5.1 The choice of wiring systems
The choice of wiring system will depend on a number of factors that the installation
designer will need to consider, depending on the particular type of installation, its
use, the environment and also any economic constraints.
In order to achieve compliance with BS 7671, it is important to select a type of
wiring system complying with the appropriate product standard, as previously
mentioned in Section D 2.
D
106
Selection and Erection – Equipment
The selection of an appropriate wiring system can be represented as a balancing act
between specification, cost and time, as depicted in the balance triangle below:
Spec’/Quality
Conflict
Conflict
Cable
Type
Cost Time
Conflict
(Speed)
The balance of any one of the three selection parameters is in conflict with
the other two, and in selecting any one cable type, compromises will need to be
made. Maintenance considerations are not shown on this diagram but should be
considered under the specification parameter. The complex criteria of specification
will be very much affected by environmental factors and the use by operators. With
this in mind, the following points will need to be considered in the specification
parameter:
• type of installation, domestic/commercial/industrial and impact protection;
• temperature of installation and local heat sources;
• effects of dust and water;
• effects of chemicals, fumes and gases;
• animals including vermin;
• movement and mechanical vibrations;
• corrosion including electrolytic corrosion;
• other environmental factors including wind, seismic effects, solar radiation,
hygiene and mould growth.
This list is not exhaustive, and experience and knowledge are key factors in selecting
the wiring system.
107
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
A key 17th Edition regulation in cable selection is the mechanical protection, or
impact protection, as required under the 522.6 group of regulations.
A concealed cable installed within 50 mm of the surface of a building fabric
(shallow) needs careful consideration as listed in 522.6.5, 522.6.6, 522.6.7 and
522.6.8. The principle of these regulations is as follows:
• the running of concealed cables in zones ‘deemed to be safe’; or,
• mechanical protection or ‘earthed metallic’ protection.
The permitted cable zones are indicated in Figure D 5.1.
Two additional regulations have been added in BS 7671: 2008 to the 522.6
‘concealed cable protection’ group of regulations as follows:
• 522.6.7 requires a 30 mA RCD for cables less than 50 mm deep run in the ‘safe
zones’ where the installation is not intended to be under the supervision of a
skilled or instructed person, and where the cable is not mechanically protected
or not within earthed metallic enclosures.
• 522.6.8 requires a 30 mA RCD for cables of any depth concealed within metal
partitions where the installation is not under the supervision of a skilled or
instructed person, and is not mechanically protected, run in zones or within
earthed metallic enclosures.
Generally, these applications ‘not under the supervision of a skilled or instructed
person’ include domestic installations and parts of an installation where members
of the public may use socket outlets (e.g. internet cafés). To save repetition, for
interpretation on where to use RCDs and the extent to which instructed or skilled
persons are included, see Section D 7.1.
To comply with 522.6 it should be noted that not all cables have to be installed in
‘heavy-duty conduit’. As an example, cables to BS 8436, which are soft or semi-
rigid cables incorporating an aluminium screen, can provide a solution. This
relatively new cable has a screen that is in contact with a bare cpc, negating the
need for special ‘earthing’ glands, and may be a solution in some cases.
Where unsheathed cables are to be used, the ‘earthed metallic’ enclosures
include:
• steel conduit;
• flexible steel conduit;
• steel trunking;
• steel underfloor trunking.

D 5.2 Circulating currents and eddy currents in single-core
installations
Regulations 521.5.2 and 523.10 give requirements concerning ferrous enclosures
and single-core armoured cables with respect to eddy currents and circulating
currents. While 521.5.2 stipulates that steel wire armoured cables shall not be used
with a.c. circuits there are other pitfalls in selecting alternative cables.
Single-conductor non-ferrous metal sheathed or armoured cables need careful
consideration due to the problems of sheath currents and eddy currents.
Circulating (sheath) currents
Circulating or sheath currents flow in the metal sheaths or armour of single-core
cables. All single-core metallic-sheathed cables have a sheath current induced by
the a.c. magnetic field surrounding each conductor. The metallic sheaths and
armoured cables are often earth-connected to equipment at both ends, providing
a closed circuit path through metal gland plates, enclosures and other metallic paths
where sheath currents are permitted to flow, as shown in Figure D 5.2.
Induced sheath currents cause a heating effect and temperature rise in metal sheaths
or armour of single-conductor cables. This is transferred to the cable insulation and,
Sheath /
Circulating
Current

D
110
Selection and Erection – Equipment
depending on the general circuit loading, this additional heat may cause the cable to
suffer premature insulation damage.
There is no recognized method for an exact calculation of the heating effect of
sheath currents and the following options are advised:
Mitigating sheath (circulating) currents – option A
De-rate the single-conductor cable current rating by a factor of up to 50%.
This will have cost and termination constraints, i.e. you may simply not be
able to terminate the cable. These cables are often transformer or generator
final connections and sizing should be rechecked; it is a fact that in many
installations power cables never achieve anything approaching their operating
temperature due to overdesign. There are many installations where single
core cables are bonded (earthed) at both ends and problems virtually never
exist. This is particularly true of the main cables between transformer and
switchgear, which in many installations only ever reach a small fraction of
their rated current. Whilst this advice may seem perhaps a bit open, ultimately
an engineering judgement is required.
Mitigating sheath (circulating) currents – option B
A second option is providing isolation of the metallic sheath or armour from
earth at one end of the cable. This is often achieved by cable termination with
a non-metallic gland plate. This is sometimes known as single point bonding.
Separate earth cables will be required to maintain the system earthing. To
ensure that metallic sheaths or armour are isolated from earthed metal,
cables will almost certainly need a non-metallic outer sheath covering. This will
ensure that sheath currents will not flow spuriously due to contact with metallic
parts such as cable trays, racks or structural steel. Due to the possibility that
isolation is not always maintained, option A might be preferred. If this method
is being used, it is recommended to limit the longitudinal voltage to 25 volts
for corrosion and safety reasons. This is estimated using the following rule of
thumb:
For trefoil cables, voltage = 0.05 mV/A/m.
For flat formation, voltage = 0.125 mV/A/m.
Eddy currents
The same magnetic fields that surround single-conductor cables can also produce
eddy currents in the steel enclosures, which completely surround the cables.

Figure D 5.3 shows how and where eddy currents are created at a metallic gland
plate.
Eddy currents can overheat iron or steel cabinets, locknuts or bushings or any
ferrous metal that completely encircles the single-conductor cables. This presents
no problem in multi-­ conductor cables, where the magnetic fields tend to cancel
each other out. For single-core cables, it is recommended that these cables enter
metal enclosures through a non-ferrous plate (e.g. aluminium). Any connectors,
glands and similar that completely surround the conductors must be of non-
ferrous materials. Slotting the equipment enclosure between the cable openings
was considered an acceptable way to reduce the effects of eddy currents, but
is no longer common practice (some feel that the practice of slotting weakens
equipment).

A typical installation comprises a multitude of joints and connections, both in
conductors and in wiring containment systems. As is seen from reading other
chapters of this book, the soundness of connections is crucial, and loose or
D
112
Selection and Erection – Equipment
partially loose connections can cause all sorts of problems, including overheating
and possibly fire.
It is imperative that such connections are made in such a way as to provide for
durable electrical continuity and low resistance. It is important that connections
in both live conductors (phase and neutral) exhibit adequate mechanical strength
and continuity to allow the current-using equipment of the circuit concerned to
function as intended. For protective conductors it is perhaps just as important
that such connections are soundly made, because poor connections will remain
undetected until the time of a possible earth fault.
The correct tightness of connections is essential to avoid particular risks from fire
or other harmful thermal effects, such as:
• Excessive temperature developed in a high resistance connection when it carries
current (e.g. load current or short-circuit current).
• Arcs or high temperature particles emitted from a loose connection.
• Poor connections giving rise to the risk of electric shock due to a malfunction
of the protective measure of fault protection. A high resistance or open circuit
in a protective conductor affecting the earth fault loop impedance may prevent
automatic disconnection. Subsequent contact of a person or livestock with an
exposed-conductive-part could be hazardous.
For the above considerations, BS 7671 makes a number of requirements
concerning the construction of electrical connections and the workmanship
necessary in carrying out such connections. All connections between conductors
and between conductors and other equipment, such as current-using equipment,
accessories or switchgear, are required to provide for durable electrical continuity
and adequate mechanical strength (Regulation 526.1).
When selecting a suitable connection, BS 7671 requires the designer to take
account of a number of factors (taken directly from Regulation 526.2), as
appropriate:
• the material of the conductor and its insulation;
• the number and shape of the wires forming the conductor;
• the cross-sectional area of the conductor;
• the number of conductors to be connected together;
• the temperature attained at the terminals in normal service such that the
effectiveness of the insulation of the conductors connected to them is not
impaired;
113
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• the provision of adequate locking arrangements in situations subject to vibration
or thermal cycling;
• where a soldered connection is used the design shall take account of creep,
mechanical stress and temperature rise under fault conditions.
Equipment may come with the following lettering on connection terminals:
• ‘R’ signifies that the terminal is suitable to accept only a rigid conductor.
• ‘F’ signifies that the terminal is suitable to accept only a flexible conductor.
• ‘S’ or ‘Sol’ signifies that the terminal is suitable to accept only a solid
conductor.
Terminals without these markings are suitable to accept cables of any type.
D 5.3.2 Compression joints
Compression joints and connections are used extensively to make connections
for terminating small copper conductors, and for large copper and aluminium
conductors.
The use of compression tools generally provides a simple and quick way of making
terminations compared with other methods. However, to make a satisfactory
termination with a compression tool, care must be taken to select the correct tool
so as to:
• match the lug (or other connector) to the conductor; and
• match the compression tool to the lug.
Generally, is it better to choose a lug and compression tool from the same
manufacturer and range to ensure compatibility. The matching of cable diameter
to lug size is critical and careful inspection of manufacturers’ compatibility data is
required as the cable overall diameters can vary.
Where the lug and conductor are not compatible, or where the lug and compression
tool do not match or are of different manufacture, problems may occur. In the case
of a lug and conductor mismatch, attempts to solve the problem by, for example,
‘filling’ the lug with additional copper strands is not acceptable.
D 5.3.3 Galvanic (electrolytic) corrosion between metals
Where certain dissimilar metals are placed in contact with each other, precautions
should be taken to prevent galvanic (also called electrolytic or dissimilar metal)
corrosion.
D
114
Selection and Erection – Equipment
There are two conditions that cause this corrosion and both need to exist for it to take
place. Firstly, there have to be two different metals present, and these need to have
different atomic properties; this is quantified by the metals’ anodic indices. Table D
5.2 shows the anodic indices for metals used in electrical installation engineering.
Secondly, there must be an electrical conductive path between the metals. The
amount of conduction depends upon water or humidity content as well as
chemical presence. To make things a little easier, Table D 5.1 details recommended
maximum differences in anodic indices for different environments.
Table D 5.1 is used with anodic indices of metals specified in electrical installation
engineering, given in Table D 5.2.
Table D 5.1 Environment type Recommended anodic difference for certain environments.
Recommended maximum
difference in anodic index (V)
Typical example environments
Normal indoor 0.51 All heated non-damp buildings, air
conditioned buildings, humidity controlled
buildings and structures
Unheated buildings 0.25 Non-humidity controlled warehouses,
unheated buildings such as churches and
barns, etc.
Outdoor and harsh
installations
0.15 Outdoor installations, ‘salty’ indoor
environments, high humidity or moisture
1 Note that the figure of 0.5 for indoor installations is a design value and there are many installations with
metals coupled with anodic differences of 0.7 and 1.0 that show no signs of corrosion after many years of
service.
Table D 5.2 Metals Anodic index of common metals.
Anodic index (V)
Nickel 0.30
Copper, silver solder 0.35

Chromium 0.5
Tin, lead tin solder 0.65
Iron and steels 0.85
Aluminium 0.9
Zinc 1.25
115
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
A remedy for making a connection is often plating the metal. For example, as can
be seen, copper can be mated indoors with steel or tin (difference of 0.5V and
0.3V respectively). If aluminium needs to be connected indoors to brass or copper,
the anodic difference is 0.55; a solution is to ‘tin’ either the brass or copper which
reduces the anodic difference to 0.25.
D 5.3.4 Accessibility of connections
Every connection between conductors, and between a conductor and an item of
current-using equipment, is required to be accessible. This is required in order that
inspection, testing and maintenance work can be undertaken during the lifetime
of the installation. However, there are certain exceptions permitted by Regulation
526–3 where this requirement can be relaxed, such as:
• a compound-filled or encapsulated joint;
• a connection between a cold tail and a heating element (e.g. a ceiling and floor
heating system, a pipe trace-heating system);
• a joint made by welding, soldering, brazing or compression tool;
• a joint forming part of the equipment complying with the appropriate product
standard.
D 5.3.5 Temperature of connections
Generally, the temperature of connections is not normally an issue where good
workmanship and good materials are used. However, there are some circumstances
where the temperature attained is of concern. For example, this would be the case
of a connection of a conductor insulated with PVC (70°C) to a busbar which is
rated for a maximum operating temperature of 90°C, and which is to operate at
that temperature.
Without measures to address the problem, the insulation will be impaired
(Regulation 526.4). A solution would be to strip back the insulation to a point
where the temperature of 70°C is not exceeded. Depending on the temperature
gradient, the stripping back of, say, 150 mm of the PVC insulation and replacing
it with suitable heat-resisting insulation would solve the problem.
For connections to luminaires, a new section has been added to BS 7671: 2008,
Section 559, see D 14.
D 5.3.6 Enclosures of connections of live conductors
Connections and joints in live conductors (and in a PEN conductor) are required to
be made within one of the enclosures (or a combination of) identified in Regulation
526.5 as follows:
D
116
Selection and Erection – Equipment
• a suitable accessory complying with the appropriate product standard;
• an equipment enclosure complying with the appropriate product standard;
• an enclosure partially formed or completed with building material which is
non-combustible when tested to BS 476–4.
An enclosure used to contain connections or joints is required to exhibit adequate
mechanical protection and be suitable for the external influences likely to be present
(Regulation 526.7). Also, the connections are required not to be subjected to any
appreciable mechanical strain, i.e. the conductors must be fixed in the vicinity of
the enclosure (Regulation 526.6).
Additionally, cores of insulated-only conductors, including those of stripped-back
sheathed cables, are required to be contained within the enclosure (Regulation
526.9).
D 5.3.7 Connections – Multi, fine and very fine wire
Regulation group 526.8 is new for BS 7671: 2008. It requires special treatment of
connections of multiwire, fine wire and very fine wire conductors and requires that
suitable terminals be used or the conductor ends be suitably treated. Regulation
526.8.2 prohibits the soldering of fine wire conductor ends where screw terminals
are used.
Soldered conductor ends on fine wire and very fine wire conductors are not
permitted (Regulation 526.8.3) where relative movement can be expected between
soldered and non-soldered parts of the conductor.
D 5.4 Wiring systems – minimizing spread of fire
Section 527 deals with minimizing the spread of fire and calls for the wiring systems
to be installed such that the building structure is not compromised in terms of
performance and fire safety.
D 5.4.1 Cable specification
The key regulation in Section 527 is 527.1.3, which states that cables should comply
with BS EN 60332–1-2.
Tests on electric and optical fibre cables under fire conditions. Test for vertical flame
propagation for a single insulated wire or cable. Procedure for 1 kW pre-mixed flame.
Cables manufactured to this standard (the ‘flame test’ standard) are considered to
be suitable for installation without any special precautions.
117
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
It should be noted that all BS EN installation cables comply with this standard
except butyl rubber flexes and hence these can only be used in short lengths.
Alternatively, cables not complying with BS EN 60332–1-2 can be used in cable
management products; these should be to one of the following standards:
• BS EN 61386 Conduit systems for cable management. General requirements.
• BS EN 500854: Cable trunking and ducting systems for electrical installations.
D 5.4.2 Sealing building penetrations
Regulation group 527.2 requires that penetrations made in building fabric should
be made good with a material that maintains the fire rating of the surrounding
fabric. Furthermore, internal fire sealing is required for metal and non-metal cable
containment systems; the only exception is internal sealing of 25 mm diameter and
smaller conduits. This requirement has proven to be most costly for organizations
that did not price accordingly, so beware.
Similarly, sealing which has been disturbed by any alteration work is required to be
reinstated as soon as practicable.
Under fire conditions, the toxic effects of PVC have long been acknowledged as
problematic when considering the effective escape of persons from build­ ings.
The importance of the selection of PVC on an installation is outside the scope of
this book as it will depend upon the view of the local authority. However, with the
increasing availability of low smoke, halogen-free (LSHF) cables, the designer can
choose to limit PVC or not use it at all.
Bulk PVC cable installations should not be used in designated fire escape zones.
It should be noted that BS 7671: 2008 uses the term ‘thermoplastic’ instead of
PVC and ‘thermosetting’ generally for LSHF cables.
Examples of cables with low emission of smoke and corrosive gases under fire
conditions are the following:
• non-sheathed single-core thermosetting insulated;
• armoured thermosetting insulated;
• elastomer insulated (types C and D only), armoured and non-armoured;
• mineral insulated (except those served PVC overall) with fittings to BS 6081.
D
118
Selection and Erection – Equipment
Some less common types of cable are given below:
• impregnated paper-insulated aluminium-sheathed (CONSAC) to BS 5593
(often used for PME power supplies);
• PVC insulated cables for switchgear to BS 6231 (used for switchgear);
• impregnated paper-insulated lead-sheathed to BS 6480 (used for HV
supplies);
• rubber insulated flexible to BS 6708 (for use in mines and quarries);
• rubber insulated cables and cords to BS 6726 (used for festoon and temporary
supplies);
• flexible cables to BS 6977 (used for lift installations).
Cables manufactured to other recognized Standards, provided they meet an
equivalent degree of safety.
D 5.5 Proximity to other services
Section 558 of the Regulations includes a few regulations on the subject of
proximity to other services and is covered in this book under Section D 4.
D 6 Circuit breakers
D 6.1 General
There is a certain overlap in this chapter with circuit breakers mentioned in
Chapter C, which covers the selection of circuit protective devices to co-ordinate
with cable sizes.
This section reviews the other selection aspects of circuit breakers as well as their
operation, and should be read in conjunction with Chapter C.
There are many types of circuit breaker available, the most common being the
thermal magnetic circuit breaker. The three types of circuit breaker in use are BS
EN 60898, BS EN 61009 and BS EN 60947. The 60898 devices generally replace
the miniature circuit breaker (MCB). ‘Miniature circuit breaker’ is a deprecated
term and these devices should all be called ‘circuit breaker’. To avoid confusion
these are referred to in parts of this book either as MCBs or occasionally as ‘60898
devices’.
119
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• BS EN 60898: Circuit breakers for overcurrent protection for household and similar
installations. These are available in ratings from 6 A to 125 A. They have three
different magnetic sensitivities, described in D 6.2 below.
• BS EN 61009: Residual current circuit breakers with integral overcurrent protection for
household and similar uses. These are combined circuit breakers/residual circuit
breakers, known as RCBOs. They are generally available in the same range
as 60898 devices, with the same overcurrent sensitivities as 60898 devices and
residual sensitivities as RCDs.
• BS EN 60947 circuit breakers replace what were known as MCCBs and air
circuit breakers.
Most circuit breakers are available in one-, two-, three- and four-pole variations.
The two-, three- and four-pole are all additionally available with neutral overload
sensing.
The basic, important requirement for the co-ordination of circuit breakers with
cables and load current, as explained in some detail in Chapter C, is given by the
formula:
Ib ≤ I
n
≤ I
z
D 6.2 Operation and characteristics
An MCB is a thermo-magnetic device, meaning that it has two methods of circuit
interruption. A thermal mechanism, usually a bi-metallic strip, provides protection
against moderate overcurrent. The heating action of the current causes the
bi-metallic strip to curve and break circuit contact. This method is complemented
by a solenoid designed to respond to larger currents.
A diagram of an MCB is shown in Figure D 6.1.
It should be apparent that the thermal trip has a slow response time and the
solenoid trip has a rapid response time. When combined, these devices provide
quite a sophisticated protection characteristic profile. The two characteristics are
now described.

2.55 In, > 32A Must trip between 1 and 120 s
Thermal characteristic
The thermal, bi-metallic characteristic is summarized in Table D 6.1.
A further co-ordination of the requirement is that of Regulation 433.1.1 (iii) which
is:
I2 ≤ 1.45 × I
z
where I2 is the current that causes operation of the device. By studying Table D
6.1, it can be seen that this requirement is built into the product standard for BS
EN 60898 devices and is effectively the calibration of the bi-metallic strip.
Magnetic characteristic
The maximum rated current available for MCBs is 125 A, and these BS EN 60898
devices are available with different magnetic sensitivities, denoted with a prefix
B, C or D accordingly. The different magnetic characteristics of BS EN 60898
circuit breakers are provided in Appendix 3 of BS 7671: 2008, but to illustrate the
differences in the magnetic characteristics, Figure D 6.2 shows a comparison of B,
C and D types for devices of the same basic rating.
A 32 A circuit breaker with type C sensitivity is denoted C32, and it is a requirement
of the equipment standard to apply this marking to the device.
The stated B, C or D sensitivities each have a minimum current that causes
operation, and this is conventionally taken to be operation within 0.1 second; this
is conventionally termed instantaneous operation or instantaneous tripping. This
minimum time convention is due to the mechanics of the circuit breaker, which
will always require a certain minimum time, regardless of current for the trip
mechanism to open.
This instantaneous tripping time of 0.1 second can be a problem where two devices
are required to discriminate, and this is also explained in Chapter C.

Table D 6.2 Type Circuit breaker (BS EN 60898) selection for inrush current applications.
Manufactured magnetic trip setting (× In) Typical applications
B 3 to 5 General domestic and resistive loads
C 5 to 10 Small motors (a few kW), small transformers
fluorescent lighting and most inductive loads
D 10 to 20 DOL motors, large star delta motors, low-
pressure sodium discharge lighting, larger
transformers, welding machine supplies
Below these threshold currents the thermal mechanism is dominant, and has the
same characteristic for all three devices. The magnetic characteristics determine
the sensitivity type. Equipment connected or likely to be connected to the circuit
must be assessed in terms of likely peak or inrush current (533.2.1).
Inrush current is the current that a load draws when the supply is switched on.
Values can range from being insignificant (a few times the normal current), 5
to10 times normal current for iron core transformers (e.g. conventional ballast-
fluorescent luminaires) and up to 20 times normal current for much modern
electronic equipment, including the power supplies found in user equipment.
While short-lived (often the peak current is a few milliseconds), this can cause
circuit breakers to trip, but assessing the likelihood of a circuit breaker tripping
is complicated. Table D 6.2 recommends circuit breaker types for typical inrush
current applications.
Separately to inrush current, load peak current also needs to be considered. Peak
current in respect of circuit breaker selection is a term used to describe a peak
within the normal operation of a cyclic or time varying load. Part C 3.1 of this
book has more information and an example of a cyclic load calculation. If you
have loads with significant cyclic peaks you need to confirm that the circuit breaker
will not trip. This can be confirmed by studying the circuit breaker characteristic
curve, but confirmation with the manufacturer may be necessary.
D 6.3 Ambient temperature de-rating
Both BS EN 60898 and BS EN 60947 provide details of de-rating factors for using
circuit breakers in ambient temperatures greater that 30°C.
D
124
Selection and Erection – Equipment
In installations where you encounter such temperatures it is best to consult the
standards or manufacturers’ data, but the following give an indication of correction
factors for 60898 devices up to 100A:
• 40°C de-rating factor of 0.85
• 50°C de-rating factor of 0.75
• 60°C de-rating factor of 0.65.
Some manufacturers also provide de-rating factors for groups of circuit breakers
mounted next to each other where they are all fully loaded. A typical de-rating in
such examples would be 0.85, but in practice it is very rare to see such loadings,
particularly on more than one circuit.
D 7 Residual current devices
D 7.1 BS 7671 applications
BS 7671: 2008 requires the fitting of RCDs as additional protection in more
applications compared with the previous editions. RCDs, with a rated operating
current of 30 mA, are now required in the following situations:
• All socket-outlet circuits accessible to ordinary or non-instructed persons
(411.3.3).
• All circuits within a bathroom (701.411.3.3).
• Concealed cables either less than 50 mm deep, in installations not intended to
be under the supervision of a skilled or instructed person, not mechanically
protected or protected by earthed metal and not run in the ‘safe zones’.
• Concealed cables within metal partitions, in installations not intended to
be under the supervision of a skilled or instructed person, not mechanically
protected or protected by earthed metal and accessible to ordinary or non-
instructed persons.
• Generally where disconnection times cannot be achieved with an overcurrent
device.
• Most TT installations, usually required to achieve a disconnection time of
0.2 s.
• Other special locations including caravan parks.
One of the most significant changes in the 17th Edition is the requirement for
RCDs to be applied to all socket-outlet circuits accessible to ordinary persons. It is
quite important to get the principle of Regulation 411.3.3 clear.
125
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
411.3.3 Additional Protection
In a.c. systems, additional protection by means of an RCD in accordance
with Regulation 415.1 shall be provided for:
(i) socket-outlets with a rated current not exceeding 20 A that are for use by
ordinary persons and are intended for general use, and
(ii) mobile equipment with a current rating not exceeding 32 A for use
outdoors.
An exception is permitted for:
(a) socket outlets for use under the supervision of skilled or instructed
persons, e.g. in some commercial or industrial locations, or
(b) a specific labelled or otherwise suitably identified socket-outlet provided
for connection of a particular item of equipment.
Note 1: See also Regulations 314.1(iv) and 531.2.4 concerning the avoidance
of unwanted tripping.
Note 2: The requirements of Regulation 411.3.3 do not apply to FELV
systems according to Regulation 411.7 or reduced low voltage systems
according to Regulation 411.8.
Let’s break down the requirement and also describe ordinary, skilled and instructed
persons.
An ordinary person is a person who is neither skilled nor instructed. A skilled
person is one with technical knowledge or sufficient experience to enable him or
her to avoid dangers which electricity may create. An instructed person is one
adequately advised or supervised by a skilled person to enable him/her to avoid
dangers which electricity may create.
Applying this to Regulation 433.1.1 (and elements of 522.6.7 and 522.6.8):
Domestic installations always involve ordinary persons, and RCDs are required
to all socket-outlet circuits. Exceptions can be made for socket outlets for specific
purposes, a common example of which would be a domestic freezer circuit. To
comply with the spirit some of these socket outlets may need labelling depending
upon their location.
D
126
Selection and Erection – Equipment
Commercial installations where individuals are employed come under the
Electricity at Work Regulations 1989 (EWR). This is also true of a single employee
workplace whatever the nature of the business. EWR requires a safe system of
working, and this means that someone in every installation will need to control
activities; the operational requirements of installations are made in BS EN 50110:
2004–1: Operation of Electrical Installations. When this requirement is combined
with the requirement under EWR for the workplace equipment to be safe and
maintained, there is no requirement for employees in the workplace to have socket
outlets with additional RCD protection. The designer must assume this to be the
case.
Falling outside of these two cases are the commercial installations with socket
outlets that members of the public can use. These would not be socket outlets in
the lobby of a commercial installation, where it is reasonable to assume they will
not be used by visitors, but would include, say, socket outlets in internet cafés for
plugging in laptops. The designer has options and will need to liaise with the client
over supervising or providing instruction to such users or fitting RCDs to socket
outlets.
D 7.2 Operation and BS 7671 requirements
Operation
Residual current devices monitor the instantaneous current flowing along the line
and neutral conductors in a circuit by means of a sensitive coil. The coil or ‘core’
measures the instantaneous resulting sum of these currents. When an earth fault or
earth leakage is present on a circuit, a small ‘imbalance’ is set up in the detection
coil and, at a certain level, causes a trip of the circuit breaker mechanism. A
diagrammatic representation of this is shown in Figure D 7.1.

The requirements for RCDs are set out in Regulation group 531.2 and are
summarized in Table D 7.1.

Requirement
531.2.1 Capable of disconnecting all the line conductors of the circuit at the same time

unnecessary tripping of the device

531.2.7 Not be impaired by magnetic fields caused by other equipment
531.2.8 Where used for fault protection separately from an overcurrent device, must be capable of
withstanding thermal and mechanical stresses
531.2.9 Where discrimination is necessary to prevent danger, device characteristics are required so
discrimination is achieved
531.2.10 For ordinary persons it shall not be possible to modify or adjust the setting of the device
without a tool or key
Most of the above requirements will be achieved automatically as they are
incorporated within the relevant product standards. This is not so for the
requirements for ‘unwanted tripping’ or discrimination, and these are now
discussed.
Unwanted RCD tripping and discrimination
Unwanted tripping
In order to avoid unwanted tripping, the most important factor of influence is the
circuit arrangement. Most modern individual pieces of equipment on a circuit
create some amount of earth leakage current and these currents add in the circuit’s
protective earth conductor. There is, therefore, a circuit limit to the quantity of
connected equipment in terms of the total circuit earth leakage. In order to reduce
the risk of unwanted tripping, the circuit should be designed so that the circuit runs
with a standing earth leakage of less than 25 % of the rated residual operating
current of the RCD.
128
Selection and Erection – Equipment
Two common sources of equipment earth leakage are as follows:
1 Earth leakage caused by power supplies, particularly switched mode power
supplies. These are used in a considerable amount of modern equipment
including computers and televisions, photocopiers etc. A rule of thumb figure
of 1 mA leakage per device is recommended for assessment.
2 Heating elements found in washing machines, dishwashers and cookers. A rule
of thumb is 3 mA for appliances up to 3 kW and 6 mA for appliances up to 6
kW.
For speculative designs and socket-outlet circuits the designer needs to take a view
on likely equipment the user will operate. Generally to achieve compliance with
Section 543.7 (high protective conductor currents), a maximum of 10 double
socket outlets per circuit is recommended.
Example: a 30 mA RCD circuit with eight PCs, two televisions and a 3 kW
dishwasher (a rather strange mix, granted, but this could be a single RCD in a
consumer unit). Based upon the above rules of thumb, the earth leakage would be
in the order of 13 mA. Under most circumstances, the RCD would not trip even
though this exceeds a good design value of 25%. However, if someone now used a
domestic kettle in the circuit, the earth leakage may trip the RCD.
This example should serve to illustrate the principle of RCD selection and its effect
on circuit design.
There are many other factors that may either contribute to or cause unwanted
tripping, including inrush currents (see Section D 6.2 for explanation), mains
factors such as noise, loose connections, poor insulation of cables of connected
equipment and radio frequency interference.
There are other causes of unwanted tripping. A relatively rare problem, but
one that is worth mentioning, is unwanted tripping that is caused by microwave
emissions from mobile cell phones. This can be an issue and exposes a loophole
in standardization. It is a valid reason in itself not to install RCDs on safety-
of-life critical circuits, along with suitable comments made on the completion
certificate.
RCD discrimination
In order to achieve discrimination between two series-connected residual current
devices where required to comply with Regulation 531.2.9, it will be necessary
to use a time-delayed residual current device at the upstream position. This will
129
D
D 7.4 D 7.5 D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
permit the downstream residual current device to respond to an earth fault on its
downstream side and avoid operation of the upstream device.
d.c. issues for RCDs
The selection of RCDs in respect of load d.c. components is an issue that is often
overlooked by designers. RCDs are classified according to their response to d.c.
signals as follows:
• Type AC This class of device generally only detect sinusoidal alternating
residual currents. They may not detect non-sinusoidal, non-alternating
residual components. These non-sinusoidal currents are present in many items
of equipment, e.g. virtually all equipment with a switched mode power supply
will have a d.c. component, as do battery chargers and X-ray machines etc.
• Type A This class of device will detect residual current of both a.c. and
pulsating d.c. and are known as d.c. sensitive RCDs. They cannot be used on
steady d.c. loads.
• Type B This type will detect a.c., pulsating d.c. and steady d.c. residual
currents.
RCDs are required to be marked with their type and Table D 7.2 shows the
markings and provides selection criteria.
TT installations and RCDs
In a TT system the earth fault loop impedance is not usually sufficiently low to
facilitate the operation of an overcurrent protective device within the required
disconnection time. This is even more the case in BS 7671: 2008 as the disconnection
time for TT installations is 0.2 s compared with the 0.4 s required in the previous
edition.
Where an RCD is used for fault protection, the product of the rated residual current
and the sum of the resistances of the installation earth electrode and protective
conductors connecting it to exposed-conductive-parts (RA) is required to be not
greater than 50 V (Regulation 411.5.3). However, it is also recommended that an
earth electrode resistance, where possible, should not exceed 200 Ω (411.5.3 note
2). This is good general advice but is a simplification, as a deep earth electrode,
say 4 m deep with resistance of 400 Ω, will be more stable than a 1.2 m electrode
with resistance of 50 Ω. For rod electrodes it is vertical depth that should be
encouraged.

In a TT installation, where a single RCD protects the whole installation, it is
essential that the device is placed at the origin of the installation (i.e. adjacent to
the electricity meter). The connections and any switchgear between the RCD and
the electricity supplier’s meter is required to meet the requirements for protection
by the use of Class II equipment or equivalent insulation (531.4.1).

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
D 8 Other equipment
There are a number of regulations grouped under Section 530 listed as protection,
isolation, switching, control and monitoring. This section lists the most relevant
points; most others do not need commenting on.
D 8.1 Isolation and switching
The ECA has always found it disappointing that the subject of isolation and
switching was so convoluted to the point that there was a separate IEE guidance
note specifically on the subject. A new Table 53 within Chapter 53 answers many
questions posed by designers or installers.
D 8.2 Consumer units for domestic installations
BS EN 60898 circuit breakers installed in domestic consumer units would not
generally comply with Regulation 432.1 where a breaking capacity of 16 kA is
quoted. However, a consumer unit that complies with the conditional short-circuit
test as described in Annex ZA of BS EN 60439–3 will meet the requirements of the
Regulations as compliance with 434.5 is achieved. This means that where a service
cut-out fuse to BS 1361 with a rating of maximum 100 A is fitted the switchgear
will be safe. This is stated here merely from a specification point of view.
D 8.3 Overvoltage, undervoltage and electromagnetic disturbances
Chapter 44 affects the selection of equipment. The chapter has been extensively
modified, for the 17th Edition gives requirements for protection against voltage
disturbances and electromagnetic disturbances. It considers these disturbances for
both internal and externally created disturbances, and is divided into four sections;
two are ‘blanks’ for BS 7671: 2008 as follows:
• Section 441: Reserved for future use.
• Section 442: Protection of LV installations against HV faults.
• Section 443: Protection against overvoltages of atmospheric origin or due to
switching.
• Section 444: Measures against electromagnetic influences. At the time of
publication this section was being developed by the Wiring Regulations
committee and will be published in a future amendment.
D
132
Selection and Erection – Equipment
D 8.3.1 HV – LV faults
The new Section 442 sets regulations for installations for supplies taken at high
voltage or for where a substation is located on the property of the installation.
Section 442 specifies a maximum ‘stress voltage’, which is a fault voltage appearing
on the LV earthing system with respect to the local earth potential.
However, installations that receive their LV supply from a utility provider do not
need to consider this section. Thus, Section 442 can be ignored unless you are
installing a private substation. In these cases reference to IEC 61936–1 Power
Installations Exceeding 1 kV a.c. will provide methods of complying with the HV/LV
co-ordination aspects.
D 8.3.2 Atmospheric and switching overvoltages
Like many parts of the Regulations, there is often confusion when reading a section,
only to discover later that most of the text is not applicable. Section 443 is a classic
case of this and is explained as follows:
• No action will be required for UK installations as installations will be in areas
where thunderstorms occur less than 25 days per year.
It is noted that equipment will need to have voltage impulse withstand levels as
specified in Table 44.3, but all equipment to BS EN standards will comply with
this. For installations overseas in areas of high lightning strike locations, surge
protection is required (alternatively a risk assessment may be carried out).
D 8.3.3 Undervoltage
Although not new, the regulations under Section 445 required an undervoltage
detection relay with appropriate resetting for installations where a sudden
re-energized state could lead to danger. Common examples of these installations
are machinery workshops and similar plants, and there are various standards to
consider, the subject of which is outside the scope of this book.
D 8.4 Surge protective devices
Although not required in the UK by Section 443 (see Section D 8.3.2), surge
protective devices (SPDs) may optionally be specified. If you are the designer you
may feel that they add a certain security to an installation. SPD selection and
installation comes down to a few simple rules, summarized as follows:
133
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• Choose SPDs complying with IEC 61643 series.
• In TN-C-S installations connect device between line conductors and earth.
• In TN-S and TT installations connect device between line conductors and
both neutral and earth.
Figures D 8.1, D 8.2 and D 8.3 show typical SPD connections in mains positions
of various supply earthing arrangements.

The length of conductors connecting the SPDs is a factor that should be controlled
due to the magnitude of both current and voltage when the devices operate, and it
is recommended that connecting tails are limited to a length of 0.5 m.
D 8.5 Insulation monitoring devices (IMDs)
Most of BS 7671: 2008’s rules (538.1) for insulation monitoring devices (IMDs)
cover their use in IT systems (e.g. for first fault conditions). This is a rare and
specialist area and is beyond the scope of this book. Some limited information can
be found in BS EN 61557–8.
D 8.6 Residual current monitors (RCMs)
Still a relatively rare device, the residual current monitor (RCM) is similar to
RCDs (see D 7.2), but instead of tripping a circuit, monitoring is provided. The
monitoring can be visual or, at a pre-determined value of residual current, it
can create an audible signal or a signal for remote monitoring. RCMs are useful
devices in main distribution panels, and in this configuration monitor several
circuits at once.
In a larger installation a three-phase RCM device positioned in the main distribution
board will be extremely useful. These devices can be widely used and Figure D 8.4
indicates examples of where RCMs are used in mains, riser and final distribution
board positions.

Selection and Erection – Equipment
The following pattern has been experienced by the author in several large
installations (load of a few MW) and has been provided here for information for
those wishing to use the devices for the first time:
• When setting the RCM, a general standing residual current will be established;
this may involve considerable fault finding for faults previously undetected.
• At certain times the residual current will probably suddenly go high; this will
often be due to equipment faults, particularly neutral earth faults which remain
undetected by overcurrent devices.
• For tracing faults, isolation of sub-boards is the easiest method, but is subject to
isolation of large parts of the installation. Where this is not possible the use of
clamp-on earth leakage current probe testers will be necessary.
• For tracing faults, user equipment should be subjected to its daily or weekly
cyclic run mode.
To serve as an example: a 2 MW installation may have 4 A of ‘normal’ residual
current, fluctuating most days between 3 and 5 A. Suddenly the earth leakage
current rises to about 15 A. This may be attributed to a neutral earth fault, present
on a lighting circuit or similar.
For smaller installations, some limited information on the devices can be found in
BS EN 62020: Electrical accessories – Residual current monitors for household and similar
uses (RCMs).
D 9 Generating sets
Section 551 was introduced in the 2001 edition of BS 7671 and has only had
limited modification for the 17th Edition.
It is key to recognize the definition of ‘generating set’ within the scope of Section
551, as it applies to more than just ‘diesel’ generators. ‘Generating set’ applies to
any power source other than the incoming or main supply, including:
• combustion engines e.g. diesel sets;
• electromotive generators e.g. wind turbines, water mill turbines;
• photovoltaic cells;
• electrochemical accumulators e.g. battery back-up cells.
The key regulations of this section are as in Table D 9.1.
137
D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Table D 9.1 Requirements for ‘generating sets’.
Voltage/frequency shall not cause damage or danger 551.2.3
RCDs in circuit remain effective 551.4.2
Fault protection (disconnection times) of system must work with various combinations of
supply
551.4
Standby supplies to have separate earth independent from mains 551.4.2
Non-permanent sets to have 30 mA RCD 551.4.4.2
The most common non-compliance item here is the requirement to provide an
independent earth. However, it is very often easy to comply with this regulation.
For most installations the use of structural steel and similar extraneous-conductive-
parts can be utilized to form a suitable earth system. Although some checking with
Chapter 54 of BS 7671 is required (see Chapter E) often the existing main bonding
elements and conductors can be utilized and are more than adequately sized for
the purpose.
D 10 Rotating machines
Regulation group 552 addresses rotating machines and makes a number of
requirements that are unique to motor circuits, and are in addition to the general
requirements, which also have to be met.
Motors of 370 W or more are required to have a device for protection against
overload (552.1.2) except where they are part of equipment complying with an
appropriate British Standard. Stand-alone motors will normally have a motor
starter incorporating an overcurrent device.
Motors with frequent starting and stopping will need a careful rating selection
due to the cumulative effect of the high starting current, and manufacturers’ data
should be considered here. As well as the motor itself, such frequent starting will
have an effect on the supply cables and other electrical equipment, which should
be de-rated. There is no guidance for such de-rating as the permutations are quite
varied, and will have to be considered individually – see the example in Section
C 3.1.
Motor control is addressed by Regulation 537.5.4. Where the restarting of a motor
after a mains failure could cause danger, a means is required (usually a relay) to
prevent the automatic restarting of the motor on re-energization (537.5.4.1).
D
138
Selection and Erection – Equipment
Regulation 537.5.4.3, whilst not new, is not always complied with and states that
where the direction of rotation is a factor relating to safety, measures to prevent the
reversal shall be taken. This effectively means supply phase rotation sensing at or
near the motor with associated automatic isolation should phase reversal occur.
D 11 Plugs and socket outlets
Regulation group 553 sets out the requirements for plugs, socket outlets and cable
couplers in terms of applicable product standards, other particular requirements
relating to pin configuration and the need for every socket outlet for household use
to be shuttered.
Except for the connection of clocks, electric shavers and other circuits having
special characteristics (see Regulation 553.1.5), the only acceptable types of socket
outlet for low voltage applications are:
• 13 A plugs and socket outlets to British Standard BS 1363 for a.c. only;
• 2, 5, 15, 30 A fused or non-fused plugs, and socket outlets to BS 546;
• 5, 15, 30 A fused or non-fused plugs, and socket outlets to BS 196;
• 16, 32, 63, 125 A plugs and socket outlets (industrial type) to BS EN 60309–2.
There are many applications where you may wish, or indeed need, to specify or
use a plug and socket not listed above. These will generally be ‘no-load’ make-
or-break devices, and are fine for applications where skilled or instructed persons
operate.
The mounting height of a socket outlet above floor level, or above a work surface,
should minimize the risk of accessory or cord damage (553.1.6). Although not
specified as a distance in the Regulations, a height of approximately 150 mm above
the floor or work surface is recommended as a minimum.
For installations in domestic premises, Part M of the Building Regulations stipulates
mounting heights for electrical equipment including socket outlets (see also BS 8300:
Design of buildings and their approaches to meet the needs of disabled people. Code of practice).
There has been some confusion with the interpretation of these requirements
since their publication. Generally, for both dwellings and ‘visitor’ areas in
commercial installations, electrical accessories should be mounted at a height
of between 450 mm and 1200 mm above finished floor level. The basis of these
criteria is to avoid problems for disabled persons that may visit a building. It is
139
D
D 12 D
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
not a design brief for a dedicated installation for disabled persons; these are quite
different.
Finally on socket outlets, Regulation 553.1.7 requires that a sufficient number of
socket outlets be provided so that long flexible cords are avoided. This should be
pointed out to clients as part of your design briefing.
Cable couplers
Excepting for SELV and Class II circuits, cable couplers are required to be non-
reversible and have provision for a protective conductor. Acceptable cable couplers
include those complying with the following British Standards:
• BS 196;
• BS EN 60309–2;
• BS 4491;
• BS 6991.
It should go without saying that the connector (female part) of the coupler is fitted
to the end of the cable remote from the supply.
Electrode water heaters and electrode boilers
Regulation group 554.1 sets out the requirements for electrode water heaters and
boilers, which are summarized as follows:
• Connected only to an a.c. supply;
• Supply controlled by a linked circuit breaker;
• Overcurrent protective device fitted in each conductor feeding an electrode;
• Shell of electrode to be earthed;
• Where the heater is three-phase, the shell of the heater is required to be
connected to the neutral conductor;
• Heaters are required to incorporate (or be provided with) an automatic device
to prevent a dangerous rise in temperature.
Generally, all heaters with immersed heating elements are required to have an
automatic device to prevent a dangerous rise in temperature. Most of these
requirements are built in to the BS and BS EN product standards.
140
Selection and Erection – Equipment
D 13 Heating conductors
With an increase in the specification of underfloor heating, the Regulations remain
surprisingly sparse in this area.
The best advice in selecting either underfloor heating cables or external buried
heating cables is to select products with recognized product standards and to
follow the manufacturers’ installation guides. There are no regulations in the
group 554–06 which specify anything that would not be included in the product
Standards.
D 14 Lighting and luminaires
A completely new section for the 17th Edition is Section 559 ‘Luminaires and
Lighting Installations’.
The new section deals with interior and exterior lighting installations and also
applies to highway power supplies and street furniture.
The following items are excluded from Section 559:
• distributors’ equipment as defined in the ESQCR 20021;
• HV signs supplied at LV, for example neon tubes;
• signs and luminous discharge tube installations operating from a no-load rated
output voltage exceeding 1 kV but not exceeding 10 kV.
1 The Electricity Safety, Quality and Continuity Regulations 2002.
Table D 14.1 summarizes the requirements. Although this table looks fairly long,
it covers all the regulations in Section 559 and, consistent with the general spirit
of this book, only regulations that are not obvious are included and subsequently
explained.
For high voltage signs, see BS 559 Specification for design, construction and installation of
signs and the BS EN 50107 series Signs and luminous discharge tube installations operating

SELV equipment but install it to 230 volt standards and this requirement will not apply (e.g. most ELV
downlighter installations).
As well as ‘throwing the book’ at you with quite a few new regulations to study
and digest, there is some helpful information in Section 559, mainly the markings

D 15 Safety services
D 15.1 Introduction
Chapter 56 of BS 7671: 2008 entitled ‘Safety Services’ covers some basic selection
and erection aspects of supplies intended for safety services. A safety service is
defined as an electrical system provided to protect or warn persons in the event of
a hazard, or essential to their evacuation.
Chapter 56 sets some fundamental requirements only, and there will be considerable
overlap with other safety service related standards in both design and installation
issues. Most of the chapter provides basic rules about standby supplies where used
for safety services.
The requirements of the chapter again have been broken down into tables, one for
equipment selection and erection and the other for circuits. Obvious regulations
have not been included.
D 15.2 Classification of break times
For an automatic safety service, the classification of changeover durations is
summarized in Table D 15.1.
Table D 15.1 Classification Classification of changeover durations for safety supplies.

D 16 Ingress protection (IP), external influences
D 16.1 General
Regulation 512.2 requires that equipment is suitable for the external influence
that it will be subjected to when installed. A large ‘matrix’ type table of external
influences with letter designations is included in Appendix 5 of BS 7671: 2008,
running to 13 pages. This can be confusing to use and is largely used by technical
committees.
D
146
Selection and Erection – Equipment
The influence of objects and water is the main criterion that needs to be
considered; other criteria, like ambient temperature, are best found from studying
manufacturers’ data.
The European Standard BS EN 60529: Degrees of protection provided by enclosures (IP
Code) is a ‘standard for standards’ document and provides information about the
degrees of protection that can be expected of equipment when allocated with a
particular IP Code.
‘Standard for standards’ means that the document is intended for use by equipment
manufacturers and equipment standards committees.
The IP code provides an indication of the protection the equipment will afford
in terms of access to hazardous parts, such as live or moving parts, ingress of
foreign objects such as tools, dirt, and liquids such as water. Exact confirmation on
particular performance should always be made with the manufacturer.
The arrangement of the IP code is made up of four characters, some of which are
optional. The arrangement of the code is as follows:
IP- International

Selection and Erection – Equipment
D 16.2 Equipment applications and examples
Sometimes, particularly in specifications, one of the first or second characters is
not specified and an ‘X’ is used, e.g. ‘IP2X’.
Perhaps a little more confusing is where the two designations are used for water.
Generally, the higher the numerals of the IP code, the higher the protection level.
This is not true where jets of water are concerned. Equipment to IPX8, for example,
is totally immersible in water but may not necessarily be suitable for jets (IPX5) or
high-pressure jets (IPX6). Equipment that is suitable for both environments will
thus require a dual marking of IPX6/IPX8 meaning protected against powerful
jets and able to be immersed.

Earthing and Bonding
E 1 Introduction
The subject of earthing and bonding in terms of installation power supplies and
BS 7671 is not a highly complicated subject. BS 7671: 2008 comprises just nine
pages of regulations on the subject, but there is probably more text written on this
subject than any other.
This chapter focuses on BS 7671 requirements and solutions, and covers all that
most readers will need. Supplementary information on earth electrodes is included
in Appendix 12, as it is not relevant for many installations.
The interaction of the facets of an earthing system, which includes protective
equipotential bonding, together with references to sections of this book, is
represented in Figure E 1.1.

BS 7671: 2008 defines or lists the types of system earthing in Part 2 – (definitions)
and these are also defined in BS 7430: 1998.
As the system earthing arrangement is such an important component, the earthing
arrangements are explained here.
The possible earthing arrangements and hierarchy are shown in Figure E 2.1.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Some relevant points to note about the various systems are now considered.
• TN-C
This system is only used in the UK by utilities and usually includes earthed
sheath return wiring (ESRW) or earthed concentric wiring.
• TN-S
A true TN-S earthing system has the neutral-earth point at the source or right
at the transformer. In practice this is rare and these systems are considered to
be TN-C-S PNB (see Figures E 2.6 and E 2.9).
• TN-C-S (PME)
PME systems are used by the utility DNOs (distribution network operators) in
most modern networks, mainly for economy and safety. A Government licence
is required to own and operate this type of system.
• TN-C-S (PNB)
Figure E 2.6 is something that should be studied, as it is a variation of a TN-C-S
system known as PNB, meaning protective neutral bonding. This variation of a
TN-C-S system is not defined in BS 7671 but is defined in BS 7430: 1998. The
electrical utility companies commonly use this PNB terminology, although it is
not so common with electrical contractors or consulting engineers.
The TN-C-S PNB system is often used to describe the earthing arrangement in
installations with on-site transformers; whilst some describe these arrangements
as TN-S they are very close to the TN-C-S PNB system of Figure E 2.6,
depending upon the position of the neutral earth link. A typical arrangement for
an on-site transformer with the neutral earth link made in the main switchgear
is shown in Figure E 2.9.

Earthing and Bonding
‘Connection A’ in Figure E 2.9 should be considered as a combined neutral and
earth conductor. This PNB arrangement is typical for most installations with an
on-site transformer. The point of neutral system earthing is at one place within
the main LV panel.
• TT
In this system the source earth is independent of the installation earth, and
hence for the latter there needs to be some form of earth electrode system.
• IT
The source is either not earthed or earthed through a high impedance. A local
IT ‘system’ can be created within a system but by considering Figure E 2.8, it
can be seen that isolation of the local fabric is required and this can be difficult
to achieve.
E 3 General requirements of earthing and bonding
The general requirements of BS 7671 for earthing are summarized in Table
E 3.1.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Chapter 41 ‘Protection against electric shock’, restructured and with new definitions
for BS 7671: 2008, is described in Chapter C. The measures of complying with
the requirements of Chapter 41 are called ‘protective measures’. The protective
measures for general application are:
• automatic disconnection of supply;
• double or reinforced installation;
• electrical separation;
• extra-low voltage provided by SELV or PELV.
The protective measure ‘automatic disconnection of supply’ is by far the most
common and makes specific requirements for both protective earthing and
protective bonding.
Again, whilst covered by Chapter C, we need to briefly review the requirements of
the protective measure in order to establish earthing and bonding requirements.
The basis of the measure is as follows.
• Basic protection (protection against direct contact) is protection from contact with
live parts provided by basic insulation, or by barriers or enclosures.
• Fault protection (protection against indirect contact) is provided by protective
earthing, protective equipotential bonding and automatic disconnection in case
of fault.
In the event of a fault between a live conductor and an exposed-conductive-
part of equipment, sufficient fault current flows to operate (trip or fuse) the
overcurrent protection.
For the protective measure to work, protective conductors are required to connect
all exposed-conductive-parts (of equipment) to the earthing terminal. This is
protective earthing and includes circuit protective conductors and the earthing
conductor. To reduce shock voltages (touch voltages during a fault), and to provide
protection in the event of an open circuit in the PEN conductor of a PME supply,
protective equipotential bonding is also required. This requirement is fundamental
to the automatic disconnection protective measure of Chapter 41.
A simple installation with both circuit protective conductors and protective bonding
conductors is shown in Figure E 3.1.

E 4 Protective conductors
E 4.1 General
Protective earthing requires exposed-conductive-parts (of electrical equipment,
likely to become live in the event of a fault) to be connected (by protective
conductors) to the main earthing terminal of the electrical installation. In the
event of a fault, sufficient current will flow around the earth fault loop to cause
the operation of the fault protective device (fuse, circuit breaker or RCD) and
disconnect the fault.
Protective bonding conductors reduce the magnitude of voltages during fault
conditions.
It should be remembered that the following are all types of protective conductor:
• circuit protective conductors (cpc);
• protective bonding conductors;
• earthing conductors.
It is important to establish and use the correct terminology; earthing conductors
are often confused with cpcs. Earthing conductors are explained in E 4.5.
E 4.2 Physical types of protective conductor
BS 7671 recognizes that virtually any metallic conductive part can be used as a
protective conductor, and this means as a cpc, a protective bonding conductor or
an earthing conductor.
Table E 4.1 details metallic conductors and other metallic parts that can be used
and provides guidance to their application.
It is strongly recommended that what could be described as ‘natural’ components
be used as protective conductors. Often these elements exist as a matter of
course, e.g. a metal pipe for another service. These items usually provide a much
better solution than running extra green and yellow copper cable for protective
conductors. The following solutions are recommended:

E 4.3 Sizing protective conductors
In order to prevent overheating of the protective conductor during a fault, the cross-
sectional area of a protective conductor(s) shall be not less than that determined by
the adiabatic formula as follows:
S =
√I
2t, or alternatively arranged as S =
I √t
k k
where:
S is the nominal cross-sectional area of conductor in mm2
.
I is the value of fault current in amperes (rms for a.c.) for a fault of negligible
impedance.
t is the operating time of the disconnecting device in seconds, corresponding to
the fault current. It is found from the protective device characteristic curve.
k is a factor taking account of the resistivity, temperature coefficient and
heat capacity of the conductor material, and the appropriate initial and final
temperatures, see Tables 54.2 to 54.6 of BS 7671.
It should be noted that where the initial cable size has been adjusted following a
thermal withstand check, further iterations may be necessary as the new size itself
affects the prospective fault current.
Alternatively, the minimum cross-sectional area of a protective conductor can be
determined by selection from Table 54.7 of BS 7671 (as below), but this virtually
always yields a larger cable.

sectional area of associated line conductor.

k1 is the value of k for the line conductor, selected from Table 43.1 in Chapter 43 according to the
materials of both conductor and insulation.
k2 is the value of k for the protective conductor, selected from Tables 54.2 to 54.6 as applicable.

164
Earthing and Bonding
It should be noted that bonding conductors should not be sized using this method;
it applies to cpcs and earthing conductors (see 543.1.1). For sizing of protective
bonding conductors, see E6.
E 4.4 Protective conductors up to 16 mm2
The sizing of protective conductors depends upon only two factors: a size for
disconnection times and a size for thermal capacity under fault conditions.
Instead of calculating the size of protective conductor for all combinations, the
tables provided in this section give maximum earth fault loop impedance values for
a number of protective device and protective conductor combinations.
When fuses to BS 1361, BS 88, or BS 3036 are used, this sets a maximum limit on
the earth fault loop impedance. Tables E 4.2 to E 4.5 inclusive give maximum test
earth fault loop impedances allowed for particular fuse and protective conductor

combinations. When the protective conductor is small the limiting factor is the
adiabatic equation. For larger sizes of protective conductor the limiting factor is
the shock protection requirement.
When circuit breakers are used to protect the circuit, because shock protection
requirements require that circuit breakers operate instantaneously in the event of a
fault, the most practical approach is to set a minimum protective conductor size for
each type and rating of circuit breaker. For completeness in Table E 4.5 below, the
maximum test loop impedance is included and these values ensure instantaneous
operation (0.1 s) of the circuit breaker.

Earthing and Bonding
E 4.5 Earthing conductor
The earthing conductor connects the system earth bar or main earthing terminal
(MET) to the system means of earthing (see Figures E 3.1 and E 6.5).
It is sized as for other protective conductors, namely either by the adiabatic
equation:
I √t
S =
k
or by using Table 54.7 of BS 7671; this is explained in Section E 4.3.
For PME installations the size of the earthing conductor must be no less than the
sizes in Table E 4.6.

Note: Electricity utility distributors may require a minimum size of earthing conductor at the origin of the
supply of 16 mm2 copper or greater for TN-C-S (PME) supplies.
E 5 Armoured cables as protective conductors
E 5.1 General
It has been common practice in the United Kingdom to use the armouring of steel
wire armoured cables as the protective conductor. This practice complies with BS
7671 and is most desirable for a number of reasons. Armouring provides a low-
impedance, robust, protective earthing system and will greatly assist any potential
EMC issues compared with the practice of running external cpcs.
Checking that the armouring is of sufficient cross-sectional area is complicated
by the armouring being of a different material (steel) to that of the conductor
(copper or aluminium). It is also complicated by the cross-sectional area for some
two- and three-core cables being less than that given by Table 54.7. In the past,
167
E
E 5.2 E
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
various organizations have suggested that certain cable configurations and sizes are
insufficient for compliance with BS 7671.
However, the remedy of the suggested undersized armour was to run an external
cable cpc in the vicinity of the cable. This subject itself posed unanswered problems
of the current sharing between the armour and the external cpc. It was thought
that current sharing under fault conditions would not be in line with the respective
impedances due to the magnetic field interaction of the armour. There was no
recognized method of approximating this current sharing.
Due to this, during 2007 ECA sponsored research on this subject by the cables
division of the Electrical Research Association (ERA). The report is included in
Appendix 16 and its conclusions are given below.
ERA report on current sharing between armouring and cpc
Conclusions
Prior to carrying out the test work described above it was thought that the
proportion of any earth fault current carried by an external cpc, run in
parallel with the armour of a cable, would be less than that predicted from
the ratio of the armour and cpc resistance. The test work has shown that
this is not the case and that using the resistance ratio will give a reasonable
estimate of the current carried by the external cpc. Comparison of the fault
current withstand of the armour of cables to BS 5467, using the k values
given in Chapter 54 of BS 7671, has shown that for all cables except the
120 mm2 and 400 mm2 2-core cables the fault current withstand of the
armour is greater than the fault current required to operate a BS 88 fuse.
Thus a supplementary external cpc is generally not required to increase the
fault current withstand of an armoured cable.
A supplementary external cpc would only be required if the earth fault loop
impedance needed to be reduced to meet the values tabulated in Chapter
41 of BS 7671. This could be the case for a long cable run where protection
against indirect contact was achieved by automatic disconnection of the
supply and the use of a residual current device was not appropriate.
(Continued.)
168
Earthing and Bonding
(Continued.)
Empirical equations have been derived for calculating the prospective fault
current where an external cpc is installed in parallel with steel wire armour.
Empirical equations have also been derived for calculating the current sharing
between the armour and the external cpc. Calculation of the current sharing
between the armour and an external cpc has shown that if a small external
cpc is run in parallel with the armour of a large cable there is a risk that the
fault current withstand of the external cpc will be exceeded. Because of this
it is recommended that the cross-sectional area of the external cpc should not
be less than a quarter of that of the line conductor.
E 5.3 ECA advice and recommendations
The ECA recommends the following:
• Use all armoured cables as a cpc without the need for a thermal withstand
check, with the exception of 400 mm2 2-core.
• Note: The 120 mm2 cable was within a few per cent of the size required
(required I2t of 33 062 500, actual 33 800 000 after 5 seconds) and should be
used without calculation unless it is intended to run the cable at full current-
carrying capacity. It is very difficult to load a cable of this size at its full current-
carrying capacity for a continuously long period.
• Where calculation software specifies external cpcs for ELI reduction, use a cpc
size of at least 25% of the line conductor csa (perhaps after manually checking
calculations).
• Manually check ELI calculations where software specifies small external cable
cpcs.
E 6 Protective equipotential bonding
E 6.1 Purpose of protective equipotential bonding
This section discusses main equipotential bonding. The purpose of protective
equipotential bonding is to:
• reduce shock voltages in the event of a fault; and
• reinforce the connection with the earth of the installation.
169
E
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
E 6.2 BS 7671 requirements
In every installation, protective bonding conductors are required to connect the
protective earthing terminal to extraneous-conductive-parts including to the
earthing system (via the main earthing terminal). Chapter 41 has a different list
of suggested items to bond than does Chapter 54 but both should be used. The
comprehensive list is as follows:
• circuit protective conductors;
• water installation pipes;
• gas installation pipes;
• other installation pipework and ducting;
• exposed, metallic structural parts of the building;
• functional earthing conductors where used;
• lightning protection system (LPS) in accordance with BS EN 623051
.
1 At the time of drafting, BS EN 62305 was under modification to state that this
bond was the responsibility of the LPS contractor in terms of both sizing and
installation.
E 6.3 Bonding solutions for the modern installation
The question still remains as to how to carry out bonding in a modern installation.
Historically, after publication of the 15th Edition of the IEE Wiring Regulations in
1981, the industry went through what can only be described as a ridiculous period
of practice. It was common to bond all exposed metalwork, including such items
as metal window frames, individual metal floor or ceiling tiles and cross bonding
to virtually everything. If consulting engineers did not insist on the practice, then
the installation contractor did!
The modern trend is now well away from this, but the question remains of what
to do about continuity of, say, the structural steel, or air conditioning ductwork
systems.
The solution advocated by the ECA for many years now is provided in this
section.
E
170
Earthing and Bonding
Commercial and industrial installations
• Take one bonding conductor to each of the items in the list given in Section E
6.2.
That’s it! See Figures E 6.1 to E 6.4 and accompanying notes.
Using constructional elements for bonding
Figure E 6.1 shows a typical commercial or industrial structure. There is a metal
superstructure either with steel beams and columns, or steel reinforced concrete.
There are many interconnected star and parallel metallic and conductive
parts. Many of these are not shown on the diagram, but consider the amount
of services and their support metalwork for the ductwork, water pipework, gas
piping, external cladding, false floor, false ceiling, lifts and, of course, the electrical
services. There really is no need for any green and yellow cable at all. Continuity
tests on this metalwork virtually always indicate a continuity approaching zero
ohms.
The best solution for main protective equipotential bonding is that indicated in
Figure E 6.4, but often the solutions shown in Figures E 6.1 or E 6.2 are installed.
The figures now follow.
Figure E 6.1 shows a typical solution which involves running separate bonding
conductors to the extraneous-conductive-parts. This is unnecessary.
Figure E6.2 shows a typical solution which involves running separate bonding
conductors to the extraneous-conductive-parts but now installed on metal cable
tray or ladder rack. This is often undertaken whether or not the tray or ladder rack
was installed for power cables.
Figure E 6.3 shows a much better and more economic solution, where the cable
tray or ladder rack has been used as a protective conductor.
Figure E 6.4 shows the best solution for most installations of this nature. The
building structure has been used as a protective conductor. The cable tray is not
shown on this diagram as it may have been installed for just a few cables, which
have now been clipped directly to the structure. Unfortunately, this technique is
under-utilized, mainly due to custom and practice. If the diagrams are considered
again, it is obvious that the structure and metal services will form part of the
bonding network whether you like it or not.

Domestic installations
• Take one bond to incoming metallic water and gas pipes.
• If there is a metallically piped central heating system, bond it in one location.
This is not necessary where any metallic pipe, bonded elsewhere (e.g. metallic
water pipe), is connected and tests satisfactorily for continuity.
• If the structure is metallic, take a bond to one location; this is not necessary for
intermediate metallic stud partitions or individual metal beams and the like.
• The central heating system will probably not need a cable bond connection if
connected by metallic gas or water pipes which have themselves been bonded
(see Figure E 6.5).

The radiator served via plastic pipe does not require a bond. The radiator served
via metal pipes will need a bond if the boiler is not itself bonded. However, it
would be better practice to bond the boiler or a pipe close to the boiler.
E 6.4 Sizing protective bonding conductors
The sizing of bonding conductors can get confusing when reading Chapter 54
of BS 7671. This is due to the fact that the suggested minimum sizes relate to the
size of the line and earthing conductor for TN-S supplies, and the supply neutral
conductor for TN-C-S (PME) supplies.
Tables E 6.1 and E 6.2 provide an easy look up for main protective bonding
conductor sizes.
Table E 6.1 TN-S, PNB, TT main protective bonding conductor sizes.

Notes:
Smaller sizes are possible by using S = (I√t)/k to calculate earthing conductor size; main bonding is half
the size of this up to a maximum of 25 mm2. A minimum conductor size of 6 mm2 shall be used and
conductors of 10 mm2 or less shall be copper.
For conductors of other material, the material must be sized to achieve the equivalent conductance of the
copper of the relevant size. See Appendices for data.
IT system earthing conductors may be sized using this table.

Note: Electricity utility distributors may require a minimum size of earthing conductor at the origin of the
supply of 16 mm2 copper or greater for TN-C-S (PME) supplies.

E 6.5 Domestic protective equipotential bonding layouts
This section provides diagrams of typical protective equipotential bonding layouts.
It has been added to provide further guidance on typical layouts of bonding
conductors, and also assists with recognizing earthing arrangements. Many other
layouts are, of course, possible.
Figure E 6.6 shows the main earthing terminal connected via the earthing
conductor to the utility cut-out stud terminal (TN-C-S).
Figure E 6.7 shows the main earthing terminal connected via the earthing
conductor to the sheath of the utility supply cable (TN-S).
Figure E 6.8 shows the main earthing terminal connected via the earthing
conductor to the installation earth electrode (TT). The earthing conductor in a
TT installation may only need to be 6 mm2 although it is shown as 16 mm2 in this
diagram.
E 6.6 Supplementary equipotential bonding
Chapter 41 of BS 7671: 2008 lists two additional measures intended to supplement
the main protective measures for protection against electric shock. The additional
measures are RDCs and supplementary equipotential bonding. The subject of
RCDs is covered in this book in Chapters C and D.
Supplementary bonding is additional protection to fault protection, and may
be required where the disconnection times of Table 41.1 of BS 7671 cannot be
achieved. However, the use of supplementary bonding does not exclude the need
to disconnect the supply for other reasons, for example, for protection against
overcurrent.
Supplementary bonding may also be required for special locations such as:
• locations with a bath or shower 701.415.2;
• swimming pools and other basins 702 .411.3.3;
• locations with livestock 705.415.2.1;
• conducting locations with restricted movement 706.410.3.10 (iii).
It should be noted that there is no requirement in BS 7671 to install supplementary
bonding in kitchens.

E 7 High earth leakage installations
The subject of circuits or equipment with high earth leakage currents was covered
in a Special Installations section (607) in previous versions of BS 7671. This
section was deleted in the international IEC document and for BS 7671: 2008 the
requirements are contained within Chapter 54, Section 543.7.
The designer of the installation needs to assess whether the equipment circuit is
likely to carry earth leakage current. It is recommended to use a figure of 1 mA
earth leakage per workstation outlet for personal computers.
The requirements are summarized in Table E 7.1 for circuits and Table E 7.2 for
individual items of equipment. The option of using earth monitoring has not been
included as it is a rather specialist area and very rarely used.

Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
F
Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
F 1 Introduction
Part 6 of BS 7671: 2008 is entitled ‘Inspection and Testing’ but covers the subjects
of certification and reporting as well as inspection and testing.
The Part comprises three chapters as follows;
• 61 Initial Verification;
• 62 Periodic Inspection and Testing;
• 63 Certification and Reporting.
The subject of Periodic Inspection and Testing is discussed in Appendix 15 of
this book as many organizations do not undertake such work, which is generally
regarded as a little more ‘specialist’.
Chapter F therefore discusses and provides explanation and guidance on the
inspection, testing and certification of new installations, including alterations and
additions.
The main part of the chapter addresses the ‘initial verification’ of the Regulations
and confirmation that the installation meets the requirements of the Regulations.
F 1.1 Inspection and testing – an integrated procedure
The activities of carrying out visual inspection and of then carrying out testing
should be considered as complementary procedures. These procedures should
not be considered to be separate functions carried out by separate individuals or
185
F
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
organizations; this is particularly true of the inspection confirmation part of the
inspection and testing.
To illustrate this point: in general there would be little point in carrying out a
continuity test on a cable if it had been found that some of its connection terminals
were loose. The defect would need to be remedied before the test was conducted.
Another aspect to consider are the stages of inspection and stages of testing for
larger installations. For many such installations the inspection is formally carried out
at the end of the constructional element of the electrical installation process; often
a separate ‘test’ electrician or engineer undertakes this task.
However, the amount of visual inspection undertaken during the electrical
construction stage is often very significant. Most electricians check visual elements
like polarity, tightness of connections, and indeed many of the items required under
the visual inspection element of inspection and testing (see Section F 2 below).
These visual checks are done as a matter of course, but often the ‘test engineer’
completes the visual inspection separately and often without consultation with the
installation electricians. It is suggested that this ‘inspection’ facet of the inspection
and testing process is more efficient, and generally better, if carried out ‘inherently’
by the installers. Of course, there are exceptions; a particular example is where
semi-skilled labour is being utilized for installation.
It is suggested, for larger organizations, that a system be created that allows the
installer to confirm facts about the visual inspection. Table F 2.1 suggests items that
can and should be carried out during the electrical construction procedure.
F 2 Visual inspection
The visual inspection part of the initial verification is the process of assessing the
installation prior to testing. Regulation 611.2 specifies the purpose of the visual
inspection, summarized as follows:
• equipment complies with a product standard (see Section D 2);
• equipment is correctly selected and erected (see Chapter D);
• equipment is not damaged.
Table F 2.1 summarizes the requirements for the inspection part of the initial
verification. To be consistent with the restructured Chapter 41 (see Chapter C) the
protective measures like ‘placing out of reach’, and similar, have been removed from
this table, as they are not considered at the installation stage. The table has been
F
186
Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
constructed with a ‘should have an automatic tick’ column. This column indicates
facets that should be automatically inspected by the installer. For example, how
can an installer install a cable if he does not know the designer’s specified cable
size? As a further example, the installer should not be terminating cables if he does
not know BS 7671 aspects relating to the tightness of connections; thus, he should
be inspecting this part of the work. This column should be inherently carried out
by the installing operative, completed on the inspection checklist paperwork and
passed to the ‘test engineer’ if this is a separate individual.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The detail of inspection to this table is covered in the other chapters of this book,
and is not expanded upon here with the exception of some labelling and warning
notices; for these, refer to BS 7671: 2008 directly.
It should be apparent that if an organization employs separate ‘inspection and test
engineers’, much of the inspection work should be a conversation and completing
paperwork exercise with the test engineer. This exercise is better if the inspection
paperwork originates with the designer and is passed on to the test engineer.
In these situations it should not be the function of the ‘test engineer’ to repeat
inspections of items confirmed by the installers; this is not a requirement of the
Regulations.
F 3 Testing
F 3.1 Introduction – pass and fail nature
This section discusses methods for achieving the physical testing requirements of
BS 7671. It should be noted that, in some books and advice, too much emphasis
is placed on particulars of test methods, often in areas that are not important and
do not make any difference to the safety of an installation.
It should be remembered that, of the seven ‘everyday’ tests required by BS 7671,
five are really pass/fail tests. Also, the test methods suggested by industry guidance
and manufacturers’ literature are just that – guidance. Other methods can and will
produce satisfactory results and may be used; and this is, of course, true of this
part of this book.
F 3.2 Required tests
The tests required by Part 7 of BS 7671: 2008 fall into two categories:
• The seven ‘everyday’ tests. These are regularly and continually used by installers
and are described in this section of the book.
• Additional tests that may be used occasionally. They would include, for
example, testing the insulation of an IT ‘floor structure’. These are discussed
in Appendix 14.
The ‘everyday tests’ required by Part 6 of BS 7671: 2008 have been required in the
Regulations for a considerable number of years. The Regulations and guidance

have suggested an order of tests based on safety and logic. The suggested order is
to carry out at least two tests prior to energization (cpc continuity and insulation
resistance, with the possible addition of polarity checks) and the remainder to be
carried out after energization. A diagram of the seven ‘everyday tests’ and the
suggested order of tests is given in Figure F 3.1.
Working to the suggested order of tests is recommended, but you should bear in
mind that some tests will require disconnection of the circuit’s neutral; the exact
order should not be cast in stone, although the dead tests should certainly be
completed prior to energization for safety reasons.
F 3.3 Continuity testing
This is the first suggested test as it is important for the safety of the circuit, and
it helps confirm a reference for the remainder of the tests. Continuity testing is
carried out on all protective conductors including cpcs, main and supplementary
protective bonding conductors.
189
F
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The test is carried out with a low d.c. voltage continuity tester, and this may detect
loose and unsound connections; other instruments may be used.
It is important to establish the path of the conductor that is being measured, as
often there will be parallel paths in circuit. This is virtually always the case in
commercial and industrial installations where parallel metalwork has a significant
bearing on readings.
Consider the luminaire circuit in Figure F 3.2 installed in a typical commercial
installation. The figure shows a luminaire mounted with a substantial metal fixing
to the structure. There are numerous earth return paths back to the source earth
point including the cable cpc, trunking, metal supports, the cable ladder rack and
the superstructure of the building. It is unrealistic to disconnect the luminaire from
these to test for continuity. Even if the luminaire had an ‘insulated’ cable supply,
unlikely in this environment, the cpc would need to be disconnected at every
luminaire on the circuit in order that the cable cpc be tested correctly. This would
defeat the object, as the connections are the most vulnerable parts of the circuit.
Thus, the only test possible is to test for continuity of the luminaire, including the
multiple parallel return paths.
In effect, the reading is confirming that the equipment under test is earthed and,
with this test, it is possible that a cable cpc is open circuit. Some do not like this
situation and it is one of the reasons that the ECA would recommend using metallic
trunking or metallic conduit as a cpc and not a cable cpc within these systems.
This brings us to the two popular methods for continuity testing, namely:
1 ‘wandering lead’ method;
2 utilization of circuit cable by ‘shorting’.
Wandering lead method
The author, mainly for the reasons given above concerning parallel returns, prefers
this method. Figure F 3.2 shows a ‘wandering lead’ continuity test.
You will notice by studying the figure that the cpc has not been removed from the
earth terminal at the distribution board. This is due to the fact that there are parallel
metallic earth return paths and removal of this conductor will not change this.
Once set up, testing using the ‘wandering lead’ method is quick and simple.
Metalwork in the vicinity of the equipment under test can be quickly checked
(often all that is needed is a piece of timber with cable and spike!). Extraneous-
conductive-parts can be checked using the same method.

It is recommended that this method be used for commercial installations with
parallel earth return paths. Also, the recording of a resistance value for each circuit
is rather pointless, as parallel paths do not fall neatly into ‘circuits’. Instead, all
equipment relevant to a distribution board is tested and the following recorded on
the test sheet relating to the distribution board:
‘All circuits tested for continuity maximum reading 1.2 ohms (luminaire
director’s office)’
As for readings, many tests using this method will show readings approaching zero
or typically less than one or two ohms.

Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
The method is simple enough, and if the line conductor is used, this method can
be used to record the circuit’s R1 + R2 value. However, the comments made in the
‘wandering lead’ method about parallel metallic return paths also apply to this
method, and therefore in virtually all commercial and industrial applications this
test only measures R1 plus a value of a parallel multi-connected return path. It is
therefore a little misleading to record results for this method as a circuit’s R1 + R2
value without a cautionary note on the test sheet.
When compared with the ‘wandering lead’ method, this test method is slow to
repeat at all outlets on a particular circuit (except for socket outlets) as it involves
access to equipment terminals.
The method does find favour with some, and can be used to establish a circuit’s
earth fault loop impedance value as discussed later.
F 3.4 Ring continuity
The continuity of ring final circuits is something that is a little more involved.
Methods have evolved over the years to establish whether the rings are indeed
wired as ring circuits, and not ‘shorted’ forming a ‘figure of eight’ layout and
similar.
Whether the 17th Edition requires this test is questionable. The best advice here is
not to use ring circuits for commercial and industrial installations.
For completeness and where ring final circuits are used, the following continuity
tests are recommended. It should be noted that the stage 3 tests involving using the
circuits cpc will suffer from the problem of parallel multi-metallic return paths as
mentioned in Section F 3.3, and unless circuit wiring, socket outlets and accessory
boxes are insulated from earth this test stage should not be used.

Measure the end-to-end resistance of each conductor, R1 (line), R

either the incorrect conductors have been selected or the circuit is incorrectly
terminated. As phase and neutral conductors will be of the same cross-sectional
area, the resistance values obtained for both conductors should be similar.
Where twin and earth cables to BS 6004 are used, and the cross-sectional area of
the cpc is reduced in comparison with the live conductors, the resistance of R2 will
be comparatively higher than that of the phase and neutral loops.

F 3.5 Insulation testing
Insulation testing is fundamental and will be used as cables are being installed. On
completion of the circuit and before energization, the circuit insulation is again
checked. The tests show faults or shorts as well as low insulation caused by moisture
and similar. Electrical equipment and appliances such as controlgear and lamps
should be disconnected prior to testing. Many such devices if left in-circuit would
F
196
Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
show as an insulation failure; also, sensitive electronic equipment such as dimmer
switches and electronic ballasts could be damaged in the test.
Insulation resistance is measured between:
• live conductors, including the neutral;
• live conductors and the protective conductor connected to the earthing
arrangement.
It should be noted that Regulation 612.3.1 states that insulation testing is to be
made between the live and protective conductors with the protective conductors
connected to the earthing arrangement. This is an additional requirement
compared with previous editions of the Standard where, for example, cable could
be tested to its cpc and then terminated. This procedure may catch you out as you
may not be accustomed to carrying it out – so please note.
The basic method of insulation testing is shown in Figures F 3.5 and F 3.6.

This minimum value of 1 MW is an increase from the 0.5 MW of the 16th Edition.
For most new circuits values would be way in excess of this, usually approaching
the maximum scale on the meter.
Lesser used, Table F 3.2 gives minimum insulation resistance values for other
circuits.
Perhaps an underused technique is that of carrying out insulation testing on groups
of circuits together as shown in Figure F 3.7, and it is recommended that this is
limited to 50 outlets per test.

F 3.6 Polarity testing
Polarity testing is very easy to carry out. There are a few methods and all of the
following are acceptable:
• visual checks where coloured cables are used;
• checks as part of the continuity testing using shorted out cable;
• neon and similar voltage probes;
• multimeters;
• indicators on ELI testers and similar.
F
200
Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
Of all of these the visual check is usually the easiest, and this test is one that is best
carried out by the person installing and terminating cables, rather than by the ‘test
engineer’.
Regulation 612.6 requires that every fuse and single-pole control and protective
device is connected in the line conductor only. It also requires a check that E14
and E27 lampholders, not to BS EN 60238, have the outer or screwed contacts
connected to the neutral conductor; but this does not apply to new installations, as
new lampholders should be BS EN 60238 type.
Phase rotation
The correct phasing of three-phase circuits must of course be checked. For all sub-
circuits this is usually completed by cable identification and shorting out cables as
appropriate. For transformers, generators and the incoming mains LV supply, a
phase rotation meter should be used to check for correct phase rotation (Regulation
612.12); follow equipment manufacturers’ instructions.
F 3.7 Earth fault loop impedance (ELI) testing
Earth fault loop impedance is required to be checked at various places throughout the
installation, and generally at every point where a protective device is installed.
For final circuits, there are two alternative methods of determining the earth fault
loop impedance:
1 Direct measurement of total ELI.
2 Measurement of the circuit R1 + R2 value and addition to the Z DB (earth fault
loop impedance at the local distribution board).
Method 2 is not favoured, as explained in Section F 3.3, but if used the general
procedure in this section for ELI measurement is followed, and this is added to the
circuit R1 + R2 value, measured as described in Section F 3.3.
F 3.7.1 External earth fault loop impedance (Ze)
Measurement of external ELI is necessary in LV supplies to confirm the supply
earth condition. External ELI is measured live at the intake position, or close to it,
with the means of earthing disconnected from the installation and the loop tester
connected to it as illustrated in Figure F 3.8. The supply to the installation will
need to be isolated. Care should be taken that the installation main equipotential
bonding is in place, or that the test is carried out under controlled conditions.
The test current on some ELI meters may make exposed-conductive-parts and
extraneous-conductive-parts rise in potential in relation to true earth, presenting a

potential hazard to persons or livestock. If main equipotential bonding is in place
the potential should be no more than a few volts.
Figure F 3.8 is a typical arrangement; in this case for a TN-C-S PME supply.
Note that all loop testers illustrated in this book are two lead meters. Three lead
loop meters usually perform the same task as two lead units if the neutral and
earth leads are connected together, but you should confirm this by consulting the
manufacturer’s data. Also note that the connection point of the live supply to the
meter is not critical to the result.
For UK low-voltage supplies the values should be no more than in Table F 3.3.

Inspection, Testing and Certification (Part 6)
Substations
It should be noted that where a transformer is installed on-site, the use of a
‘contractors’ ELI meter is inappropriate. Small values of resistance cannot be
measured on conventional ELI instruments. Confirmation of impedances and d.c.
resistance can only accurately be made by calculation and inspection or by the use
of ‘milli-ohmmeters’ utilizing four lead connections. Both methods are outside the
scope of this book.
Conventional ELI meters can be very inaccurate at resolutions below 0.1 ohm.
Even at readings of 0.2 and similar a digit ± fluctuation has to be applied, and this
should be borne in mind when reading the meter at low values (you may have a
negative ELI value!).
F 3.7.2 Testing for total earth fault loop impedance (Zs)
As mentioned in Section C, earth fault loop impedance may be required at various
points throughout the installation and will generally need to be measured at every
level of protective device.
For confirmation of final circuit disconnection times where RCDs are not installed,
measured total earth fault loop impedance is usually required for all circuits.
Z
s may be carried out by direct measurement at the extremity of a circuit.
Alternatively, Z
s may be collectively measured using the components in the
following formula:
Z
s
= Z DB + (R1 + R2)
where:
Z DB is the earth fault loop impedance at the distribution board supplying the
final circuit;
(R1 + R2) is the circuit measured line-cpc loop resistance (see Section F 3.3).
Whilst carrying out Z
s testing, both the main equipotential bonding and the means
of earthing are left connected. This advice was given by the ECA for a number
of years in order to maintain consistency between Z
s results when carrying out
periodic testing and testing new installations. When carrying out periodic testing,
disconnection of earthing and bonding is simply not practicable. The ECA advice
was adopted by the IET.
203
F
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
This does mean that in some installations Z
s
values measured directly will be less
than those measured using the collectively measured Z
s
= Z DB + (R1 + R2) formula.
When comparing the results of measured earth fault loop impedance values with
design values, this possible discrepancy should be remembered, as should the
matter of possible parallel metallic earth return paths.
The physical measurement of ELI is generally as shown in Figure F 3.9, and it
should be remembered that RCDs in circuit will trip unless the test instrument
has a facility to block unwanted tripping. Some ELI testers can test at such small
current levels that they are below the threshold of tripping. Alternatively, the RCD
must be linked-out of the circuit.
The measured values of Z
s should be less than the values given in Chapter 41
of BS 7671: 2008 Tables 41.2, 41.3, 41.4 and 41.5, which are reproduced in
Appendix 3. It should be noted that the limiting ELI values given in these tables
are design values and should be de-rated by a factor of 0.8.

F 3.8 Prospective fault current testing
Regulation 612.11 requires that the prospective fault current, IPF
, under both
short-circuit and earth fault conditions, be measured, calculated or determined by
another method, at the origin and at other relevant points in the installation. For
domestic and LV supplies the utility values can be used and measurement is not
required (the utility value is a maximum of 16 kA).
Fault current measurement, however, is quite easy to measure for modest fault
levels. Most earth fault loop impedance meters double as fault current measuring
devices, capable of measuring phase-neutral prospective fault current as well as
earth fault current. Figure F 3.10 shows measurement at two positions within an
installation.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Bear in mind that these instruments simply measure the loop impedance and,
by Ohm’s law, calculate the fault current. This will give an overestimate of fault
current as the fault will have a low power factor, not taken into consideration by
the ELI meter.
Some test instruments are capable of measuring line-to-line fault current. These
work by measuring the line-to-line loop impedance. If these instruments are not
used the three-phase fault current is approximated as twice the single-phase level.
Testing RCDs and other functional tests
Regulation 612.13.2 requires that switchgear and control gear assemblies, controls
and interlocks be functionally tested to check that they work as required. This is
part of the commissioning of the electrical installation and not part of the subject
of this book.
RCD testing
RCDs should have their functionality tested by operating the integrated ‘trip’
button. BS 7671: 2008 only requires operating time testing of RCDs where fault
protection is provided by an RCD. Where final circuits have overcurrent protection
by a fuse or MCB, here are a couple of options:
• either test the RCD and rely on this to achieve the disconnection time (usually
within 0.4 s); or
• test the circuit for Z
s and if compliant with the tables in Chapter 41, RCD
testing is not essential.
In similar fashion to other daring statements in this book, some may be
uncomfortable with this suggestion, but you should consider that RCDs are
a manufactured ‘type-tested’ device; we do not routinely test the operating
characteristics of MCBs.
RCD testing itself is relatively simple in terms of using your test instrument
connected on the load side of the RCD; Figure F 3.11 shows a typical RCD test.
Interpreting results, especially with time-delayed RCDs, can be a little confusing.
Table F 3.4 summarizes the maximum RCD trip times for comparison with
measured results and includes minimum trip times for time-delayed RCDs.

F 3.10 Verification of voltage drop
Notes have been included on this subject because it appears in Part 6 of BS 7671:
2008 and gives rise to some confusion.
Regulation 612.14 gives two methods for checking voltage drop, either by
measuring a circuit’s impedance or by checking design criteria.
The regulation only suggests doing this where it is necessary to verify compliance
with the voltage drop requirements. In practice, this will mean where there is a
voltage drop problem.
The single most important factor that will affect voltage drop under running
conditions is the running current, of both the circuit and the whole installation.
F 4 Certification paperwork
F 4.1 Introduction, various certificates and schedules
Part 6 of BS 7671: 2008 requires various certificates and schedules to be issued on
completion of the installation as follows:
• a completion certificate; or
• periodic report form where undertaken; and
• accompanying either of these, results of inspection and test.
This chapter provides in Section F 4.2 a brief overview of the various certificates
and accompanying schedules, and a line-by-line brief of how to complete the
various forms, in Section F 4.3.

Special Locations
G 1 Introduction: Purpose and principles
G 1.1 Introduction
Part 7 of BS 7671: 2008 makes specific references to electrical installations in areas
defined as ‘Special Installations or Locations’. As well as having to comply with
the general requirements of BS 7671, some further requirements or restrictions
apply to installations in these special locations. The term ‘special’ therefore means
application of particular requirements in addition to the general rules of BS 7671
within Parts 1 to 6.
BS 7671 introduces some six new ‘Part 7’ special locations making a total of 14 in
all, and the complete list is shown in Figure G 1.1. The provision of special locations
sections has increased in IEC over the years, and it may be argued that in some
cases they are not really ‘special’, but they have been accepted internationally.
Some of the special locations in BS 7671: 2008 locations are not discussed in this
book, as most designers and contractors do not get involved with them. Figure G
1.1 shows the Part 7s discussed in this book and those that are not.
Some requirements have been removed from those provided in the 16th Edition,
for example, Section 607 ‘High protective conductor currents’ and Section
611 ‘Installation of highways power supplies, street furniture and street located
equipment’; these sections have both been incorporated into the general rules, i.e.
543.7 and 559.10, respectively, of the 17th Edition.

G 1.2 Purpose and principles
In general, such ‘Special Installations or Locations’ listed in BS 7671 involve
increased risks and/or harsher conditions compared with those catered for by the
general parts (Parts 1–6). Risk here is risk of danger as defined in part 2 of the
Regulations:
• Onerous site conditions that may impair the effectiveness of the electrical or
environmental protective measures.
• Increased risk of contact with earthed metalwork, usually extraneous-
conductive-parts.
• Water or condensation giving reduced body resistance and better electrical
contact.
• Absence of shoes or clothing (e.g. bathing or swimming) and therefore a greater
opportunity to make contact with live parts or earthed metalwork, or actual
contact with Earth itself.
G
220
Special Locations
The requirements for such locations have been developed by continual assessment
of such risks, and the application of protective and environmental measures
seen to be necessary to reduce the foreseen risks. Designers and installers must
assess the environment, use and risks at the locations for which they are designing
and constructing installations, and make provisions accordingly – a high level of
competence and relevant experience is required. Designers and installers must
also comply with the requirements of legislation and relevant building regulations.
Installations must be properly verified and commissioned, with initial inspection
and testing as required by Part 6 of BS 7671.
All installations must be properly maintained and periodically inspected and tested,
depending on their age, application and condition. An assessment of the expected
maintenance that an installation will receive should be made as part of the design
process, and if necessary the design and materials selected should be amended
accordingly.
G 1.3 Particular requirements and numbering
It is the case that Part 7s are intended to supplement or modify the general
requirements of Parts 1–6. In line with this is new numbering, which is meant to
highlight the particular requirements; this uses the Part 7 numbering followed by
the ‘general rules’ clause. An example from 701 (bathrooms) is as follows:
701.41 Protection for safety: protection against electric shock
701.410.1 General requirements
701.410.3.5 The protective measures of obstacles and placing out of reach
(Section 417) are not permitted.
Regulation 410.3.5 in Part 4 of the Standard has been modified for this Part 7
Regulation 701.410.3.5 above.
G 2 Locations containing a bath or shower (701)
G 2.1 Introduction and risks
Bathroom installation regulations have perhaps always been somewhat contentious
and have undergone a number of changes in requirements in the last ten years. The
requirements have again changed in the 17th Edition of BS 7671 and indeed have
221 G
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
become simpler. This part now harmonizes with the corresponding CENELEC
part, and introduces some significant changes for the UK.
In a bathroom or shower room the increased risks are from exposed wet skin (with
a lower contact resistance), the splashing and ingress of water, and the usual close
proximity of earthed metalwork. There may also be further risks due to disability or
infirmity. Medical locations are not considered in detail, and such medical locations
as birthing pools need special provisions outside the scope of this document.
G 2.2 Zone concept
The concept of zones was introduced into BS 7671 for the 2001 edition and
allowed different rules to be applied to different areas. The concept of zones
remains in BS 7671: 2008 but Zone 3 has been removed. This is one of the most
significant regulation changes in the whole document; without a Zone 3, there are
no specific rules for Zone 3 and only the general rules apply. Hence, equipment
can be installed at the boundary of Zone 2.
The zones provide a means of controlling the location type and environmental
rating of electrical equipment installed in a bathroom. They are only a guide
and, regardless of this, the installation must be properly designed to take into
account all foreseen risks in the design of a bathroom within a particular building.
The Regulations actually apply to ‘locations containing a fixed bath or shower’,
and this can therefore include bedrooms, changing facilities in workshops or
sports clubs, etc. These will require different design solutions from those for a
domestic bathroom, and in all cases full consultation with the client’s advisers and
equipment manufacturers is essential. Unfortunately, not all electrical equipment
or accessories have IP ratings, but manufacturers will be able to provide guidance
in the selection and application of their products.
The zones are specified in regulations and are summarized as follows:
• Zone 0 is the bath or shower tray.
• Zone 1 can be considered to be the area where the individual is bathing or
showering, or the area where shower water is likely to be directly sprayed.
• Zone 2 is the area beyond Zone 1, extending by a further 600 mm.
The layout of the zones is illustrated in Figures G 2.1 and G 2.2 for a number of
bathroom and shower room arrangements. Other layouts such as bedrooms with
shower cubicles, changing rooms and the like must be considered; the concepts of
the zones should be extended accordingly.

For electrical provisions the general requirements of BS 7671 apply, but the extra
provisions in Section 701 must supplement these. Obviously, not all the protective
measures for installations are applicable in bathrooms; the protective measures
for obstacles, placing out of reach, non-conductive locations and earth-free
equipotential bonding are not permitted, and it is not difficult to see why.

Electrical separation can only be used for single items 701.413
For SELV and PELV basic protection must be used 701.414.4.5
G 2.3 Electric shock requirements
The requirements in addition to the general rules are summarized in Table G 2.1.
Perhaps the most significant change in this section in the 17th Edition is the fact
that there are only regulations for Zones 1 and 2. Outside of Zone 2 the general
rules of the Standard apply, but in reality virtually any equipment can now be
installed outside Zone 2. The only caveat concerns socket outlets, where Regulation
701.512.3 prohibits them within 3m of the outer limit of Zone 1 (unless they
are SELV). Some individuals will feel uncomfortable installing socket outlets even
under these conditions (and despite the fact that they will be RCD protected, see
below).
All circuits supplying the bathroom are now to be provided with additional
protection by the use of an RCD with a rated residual operating current not
exceeding 30 mA. However, where this is provided, supplementary equipotential
bonding is not required.
The use of RCDs on all circuits, including lighting circuits, may cause some
problems initially (e.g. with possible increased risk of hazards if lights go out
unexpectedly). These can be overcome relatively easily with some planning; e.g.
the bathroom on a separate lighting circuit or two lighting circuits for the bathroom
and surrounding rooms.
Protection by electrical separation may be used, but this is a difficult concept to
achieve in practice and is usually only provided as a shaver socket outlet; however,
the supply to such an outlet will still require RCD protection.
G
226
Special Locations
Separated extra low voltage (SELV) systems may be installed, but again these are
difficult to achieve in practice, and need to be maintained and controlled by a
competent person. Protected extra low voltage (PELV) systems are more common
but again difficult to achieve in practice and must be properly designed and
specified, so such systems are rarely utilized.
The requirements of the 17th Edition of BS 7671 are not retrospective. This
edition, however, now allows that supplementary equipotential bonding is not
required in bathrooms provided that each circuit in the bathroom is provided with
additional protection by an RCD sensitivity not exceeding 30 mA. This will be the
preferred solution in new developments, but there are many existing dwellings and
other locations with bath and shower facilities that already have supplementary
equipotential bonding, and when bathrooms are modified or refurbished it may be
more economic to extend or modify this rather than rewire and install RCDs.
G 2.4 Equipment selection and erection
The equipment requirements of Section 701 are summarized in Table G 2.2,
and the requirements fall into two types of regulation – ingress protection and
suitability as regards switches and accessories.
Table G 2.2 Requirement Bathroom equipment selection and erection requirements.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
The general principle of this group of regulations is that unsuitable electrical
equipment must be inaccessible to persons in the bath or shower (when they are in
the bath or shower, Zone 1). This is deemed to be outside Zone 2.
This ‘inaccessibility’ principle extends to electrical equipment generally, and only
switches using insulated linkages or pull cords to operate BS 3676 devices, or
specially designed controls to BS 3456 (instantaneous water heaters), are permitted
within the zones. It is accepted, however, that a shaver supply unit with a BS
EN 61558–2–5 transformer may be installed, as may switches supplied by SELV
where the nominal voltage does not exceed 12 V rms.
Fixed equipment within the 2.5 m zone must be selected and erected according
to foreseen risks, and its likely duty. The likelihood is for splashing water to be
present, and this requires an IP rating dependent on its location in the room. Power
showers can generate penetrating jets of water, and may require a minimum of
IPX5 equipment.
BS 7671 does not actually prohibit the use of Class I fixed equipment for outside
of Zone 2, but luminaires to be fixed within these areas should preferably be either
totally enclosed, or if of Type B22, should be fitted with a BS 5042 (Home Office)
shield.
In general, those responsible for selection and erection of equipment will find that
Class II devices more readily satisfy the requirements of bathrooms.
With the increased use of pumped water in bathrooms for spa-baths, power showers,
etc. there is a need, on occasion, to provide for motive power within the area of
the bath. In order to protect against direct and indirect contact, supplies for such
equipment must be by SELV with the nominal voltage not exceeding 12 V rms.
Where it is necessary to mount the SELV source within the bath enclosure, then it
may only be accessible by means of a tool. The reason for this is concerned with
the now familiar definition of a skilled person, i.e. it is assumed that persons using
a tool to access the SELV source under a bath will be sufficiently informed and
skilled to avoid danger and that the circuit will be dead and isolated before work is
commenced.
G 3 Swimming pools and other basins (702)
G 3.1 Introduction and risks
BS 7671: 2008 maintains the next Special Location in Part 7 as ‘Swimming Pools
and Other Basins’. The ‘other basins’ is important as the section applies to the
G
228
Special Locations
basins of fountains and to areas in natural waters including the sea and lakes,
where they are specifically designated as swimming areas.
Swimming pools and basins pose similar risks to bathrooms, in that people are
generally unclothed and body contact resistance is low. One major difference to
keep in mind, however, is that generally there are several people in the pool area
and usually only one person in the bathroom.
Some fountain basins are likely or even expected, to be occupied, and as such
they should be treated as swimming pools as far as BS 7671 is concerned. Often a
risk assessment will need to be carried out to assess whether fountains need to be
treated as fountains or as swimming pools.
G 3.2 Zone concept
Again, the swimming pool or fountain basin is first divided into zones in order that
regulatory requirements can be prescribed for each zone. The zones for swimming
pools are shown in Figures G 3.1 and G 3.2 (pools above and below ground).

702.55.4
To further assist with the tables, the following notes have also been included for
extra clarification and guidance.
Apart from underfloor heating there is no specific requirement for a metallic grid
in the floor (this was deleted by amendment of the 16th Edition). Connections to
the protective conductors of exposed-conductive-parts may be made locally to
the equipment or at a local distribution board or control panel, depending on the
installation design.
Extraneous-conductive-parts are conductive parts not forming part of the electrical
installation and liable to introduce an electric potential, including the electric
potential of a local earth. For Section 702 this means a potential from outside
Zones 0, 1 and 2 into these Zones. Such parts may include the following:
• metallic pipelines for fresh water, waste water, gas, heating, climate and other;
• metallic parts of building construction;
• metallic parts of the basin construction;
• reinforcement of non-insulating floors;
• reinforcement of concrete basins.
Floors made of individual concrete tiles whose reinforcement is fully encapsulated
within the tile and not accessible without damaging the tile, need not be included
in supplementary equipotential bonding.
Concrete tiles without metallic reinforcement, tile coverings as well as topsoil (e.g.
lawn) need not be included in supplementary equipotential bonding.
The following conductive parts are not regarded as extraneous-conductive-parts
provided that they cannot introduce a potential to Zones 0, 1 and 2; they need not
be included in supplementary equipotential bonding:

• basin ladders;
• basin barriers;
• diving structures, ladders;
• handrails and handholds on the rim of the basin;
• grid covers including the mounting frames of overflow pipes;
• window frames;
• door frames;
• starting blocks;
• other similar items.
For fountain basins, cables run to supply lighting equipment in Zone 0 are to be
run outside the basin as much as possible, and take the shortest practicable route in
Zone 0 to the equipment. Cables must be suitable for total continuous immersion
and type H07RN8-F is recommended. If it is possible for people to get into the
basin, cables should not be installed.
Socket outlets are not permitted in Zones 0 or 1 of a swimming pool area, and are
normally only permissible in Zone 2 if they are supplied either by SELV, the source
being installed outside the zones, or by the application of electrical separation;
again the transformer being outside the zones, or protected by a 30 mA RCD.
Pool cleaning equipment at mains voltage or special equipment should only be
brought into the pool area when it is empty of swimmers, and supplied from
sockets outside the zones.
Agricultural and horticultural premises (705)
234
Special Locations
G 4.1 Introduction, purpose and principles
BS 7671: 2008 includes this Section 7 for fixed electrical installations inside and
outside agricultural and horticultural buildings, including locations where animals
are kept.
It does not apply to residences or other locations such as shops, workshops or
storage areas in agricultural premises.
These locations are characterized by arduous conditions, and people usually
working in a wet or damp environment, both indoors and outdoors. An increased
risk of damage to the electrical installation and an increased risk of personal
danger can come from a number of factors, including:
• the use, possibly widespread, of chemical cleaners and fertilizers;
• behaviour and nature of animals (stock and vermin);
• agricultural machinery;
• frequent wet and damp conditions;
• lower body resistance of livestock.
It should be noted that danger, including the risk from electric shock, particularly
applies to livestock. In places where livestock is kept, there is a greater risk of electric
shock to them due to their lower body resistance and more intimate contact with
the general mass of earth. It can often be seen in milking parlours that cows will
not pass from one place to another where they sense a small potential difference
between their front and rear legs.
G 4.2 Requirements and guidance
The requirements of the section are summarized in Table G 4.1.
As well as Table G 4.1 the following notes and guidance are provided.
As applies generally to special location areas, protection by the use of obstacles,
placing out of reach, non-conducting locations or earth-free equipotential bonding
is not allowed in agriculture/horticulture due to the extra risks involved in such
wet and exposed locations, as operators are usually non-technical staff (ordinary
persons).
Wiring systems and electrical equipment and accessories must be suitable for
the location and environment of their use. Arduous conditions including animal
housing, cleaning chemicals, wash down with hoses, vermin, physical impact damage

etc. are all possible, and the selection and erection of systems and equipment must
provide proper protection and safety.
All electrical equipment should have physical protection to withstand wash down
and the use of chemical cleaning agents, and will require special considerations
against corrosion. High impact plastic materials may be better than metals, but
these cannot be considered to be a Class II installation. Generally, the best physical
protection will be provided by careful placement of outlets and controls in areas
where they are not likely to be subject to damage or impact.
Electrical equipment must be protected against the ingress of both solid particles
and water, depending upon its location, and BS 7671 recommends a minimum
rating of IP44 under normal conditions; equipment not so rated should be enclosed
G
236
Special Locations
within an enclosure rated to at least IP44. This may, however, not be practical for
all items, such as sensors or controls, and other alternatives, such as locating these
in safer areas (if possible) may be necessary. IP44 is really a general minimum, and
an environmental assessment must be made at the design stage and equipment
selected accordingly. It must be noted that IP ratings are not ‘all inclusive’ and their
application to various environments must be considered. For example, IPX8 may
be suitable for total immersion, but it may not be suitable for water jets and areas
being hosed down (see D 16.2).
In areas with no specific risk, e.g. residential areas, offices, shops and similar locations
belonging to agricultural and horticultural locations, a normal residential level of
protection should be adequate, but if there is any extra risk, e.g. the practice of
using extension leads into other areas (which should be avoided), further provisions
may be necessary.
Special consideration must be given to earthing and bonding to ensure its integrity,
and stranded conductors are recommended, especially in areas where vibration is
likely to be experienced.
Earthing and protective bonding conductors must also be protected against damage
and corrosion, and BS 7671 suggests minimum cross-sectional areas of conductors
of various materials (see Chapter E).
The reduced disconnection time of 0.2 s of the 16th Edition has been deleted
for the 17th Edition, and there is now no difference between the special locations
disconnection time requirements and those specified in Chapter 41. Again, the
use of RCDs is seen as a positive safety benefit, but the designer must consider
the possible consequences of loss of electrical supply to farm buildings or systems
that may provide life support for animals or other safety services. Indeed, the
requirements for agricultural and horticultural installations in the 17th Edition call
for the consideration of supply security and possible standby supplies for animal
life-support or comfort systems.
The general requirements of Part 4 of BS 7671 apply, and in all circuits, whatever
the type of earthing system, 30 mA RCDs (to the requirements of Regulation
415.1.1) are to be provided for all socket-outlet circuits up to and including 32 A
socket outlets, and a 100 mA RCD (again, to the performance requirements of
Regulation 415.1.1) must be provided for circuits with socket outlets over 32 A.

Figure G 4.1 Required earth bonding in milking parlour and similar.
In livestock locations all exposed-conductive-parts and extraneous-conductive-parts
that are accessible to livestock must be connected together with supplementary
equipotential bonding. Figure G 4.1 gives an illustration of the requirement.
Where a metal grid is installed in the floor, or there are extraneous-conductive-parts
in or on the floor, e.g. structural steel components, or cattle pens with ‘cast in’ items
embedded in the concrete, or concrete reinforcing, they must be connected to the
supplementary equipotential bonding. The illustrations in Figure G 4.1 are only for
general guidance and other suitable bonding arrangements are quite acceptable.
If a bonded metal grid cannot be laid in the floor of animal houses during construction
or refurbishment, it is recommended that a TN-C-S (PME) electricity supply is not
used. A TN-S supply is preferred. If a TN-C-S supply is offered or is the only type
available, it is recommended that a separate local earth electrode be installed.

G 5 G 5.1 Special Locations
Fire has always been a significant risk in agricultural and horticultural buildings,
with the amount of flammable materials used and stored in them. A lot of fires are
put down to ‘electrical faults’ and, although the use of RCDs cannot be guaranteed
to prevent the risk of electrically ignited fires, correctly selected RCD protection can
reduce electrical fires caused by earth leakage current ignition. For fire protection
purposes, an RCD with a rated residual operating current not exceeding 300 mA
is advised, and a lower operating current may be appropriate depending on the
installation and loads supplied.
Lastly, if electric fences are installed, details of operation and maintenance should
be provided to the user of the installation.
Caravan parks and camping parks (708)
Introduction, purpose and principles
The 17th Edition has two separate sections concerning caravans, Section 708
covering caravan parks (and including camping parks) and a new Section 721
covering caravans and motor caravans. The latter, Section 721, is not included
within this book as it is concerned with the internal wiring within caravans.
Section 708 does not apply to installations for mobile homes and similar and its
scope is for ‘caravan parks/camping parks’ as defined in the Standard, as follows:
Caravan park/camping park: Area of land that contains two or more
caravan pitches and/or tents.
Whereas a caravan is defined as:
Caravan: A trailer leisure accommodation vehicle, used for touring, designed
to meet the requirements for the construction and use of road vehicles.
Caravan parks are laid out with ‘caravan pitches’ in the form of spaces to
accommodate the caravans, and the layout will depend on the shape, topography
and nature of the site. Most sites are laid out with the caravans in a regular
arrangement to maximize the space, as parks are commercial enterprises. Others
have trees, etc. and other features that make the park attractive and these need to
be accommodated.
239 G
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
Caravans are for touring, and can travel throughout Europe, and farther, so their
electrical installation may have to accommodate the different electrical practices
of various countries, thus Section 721 requires the provision of a 30 mA RCD to
the requirements of Regulation 415.1.1 to be provided within UK caravans.
G 5.2 Requirements and guidance
The requirements of BS 7671 are summarized in Table G 5.1.
The park provides an electricity supply at each pitch, and generally these supplies
are provided by the use of a 16 A SP&N ‘industrial’ socket outlet to BS EN 60309–2.
Some larger supplies may exist for very large caravans, but generally these would
not be touring types.
As usual with special locations the protective measures of obstacles, placing out
of reach, non-conducting location and earth-free equipotential bonding are not
allowed as the parks and caravans are used by ordinary persons, and the installations
cannot be under effective supervision at all times.
The electricity supply to a caravan park must be a TN-S supply to the caravan
pitches. A TN-C-S supply is not acceptable as the common problems with a broken
or lost neutral could make the metal frame and skin of a caravan live with respect
to the general mass of earth, and this would be potentially dangerous for anyone

Special Locations
touching earth and the caravan at the same time. A TN-C-S system is allowable,
however, in fixed buildings on the park, offices, shops, clubhouse, stores etc. and
these can be treated as any other building.
Two common methods are used for installations with supplies with a TN-C-S PME
incomer. The first is to break the PME at the distribution board that supplies the
caravan pitches. The second, more popular, method is to break the PME supply
at the pitch outlets. In both cases ‘breaking’ is normally carried out by terminating
the earth cable sheath or similar on an insulated enclosure.
As parks are usually in exposed locations, particular care must be taken in selecting
wiring systems and equipment, and further mechanical protection may be required
for some applications. Generally pitch socket outlets should be IP44 if they are
enclosed or protected from the elements, and higher IP ratings will be necessary if
they are exposed. Impact protection must be considered, and it may be necessary
to protect exposed cables with conduit or steel channel. The 17th Edition advises
mechanical stress protection to AG3 (high severity) of Appendix 5 of BS 7671 but
this does not give any practical advice as to what would be required.
Cables should be run round the site underground, but this may not be possible in
all locations due to soil depth. The recommended minimum depth of cable burial
is 600 mm, but where this cannot be achieved, mechanical protection must be
provided if there is any likelihood of cable damage. Cables should be run round
the edge of pitch locations or along road verges to reduce the possibility of damage
caused by digging in pitch areas, or pegs or spikes used for awnings or tents.
Overhead conductors should only be considered where buried cables are not
practical, and they should be high enough over roadways, or kept away from traffic
routes to prevent damage from tall vehicles or caravans, as well as aerials, chimneys
and other projections that may be on caravans. Overhead conductor supporting
poles should also be located away from vehicle routes to avoid possible impact and
damage.
Each caravan or tent pitch should be supplied with a conveniently located socket
outlet to allow the caravan to connect easily and safely with its standard flexible
connector.
In regularly laid-out parks, each group of perhaps four pitches would have a power
supply location centrally located, but with irregularly laid-out parks this will not
be so. Each socket outlet shall have individual overcurrent protection and a 30 mA
RCD.

Special Locations
The 16th Edition of BS 7671 allowed up to three socket outlets to be supplied from
one circuit and RCD, but the 17th Edition now requires each outlet to have its own
RCD, to prevent interruption to other supplies by a faulty caravan. RCDs are to
comply with the requirements of Regulation 415.1.1 and must be multi-pole.
Socket outlets should be fixed between 500 mm and 1500 mm from the ground to
allow easy access and prevent damage from equipment or the elements. In cases
where flooding may be expected, this height should be increased. The 16th Edition
allowed socket outlets to be between 800 mm and 1500 mm from the ground, but
this change in minimum dimension does not make installations carried out to the
16th Edition in any way unsafe, and the Regulations are not retrospective. This
must be remembered during safety inspections. The further provision of RCDs in
the 17th Edition has the same effect and does not affect safety.

extension lead and caravan inlet.
G 6 Exhibitions, shows and stands (711)
© Masterfile (Royalty-Free Division)
243 G
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
G 6.1 Introduction and risks
Section 711 of the special locations requirements applies to temporary exhibitions
and shows, and the stands and exhibition equipment used in them. The section
should not be applied to permanent exhibitions and shows, or to the permanent
fixed installations of exhibition halls or show grounds that accommodate the
exhibition. Vehicles or caravans that are used as prefabricated exhibition stands
are included in this section.
The major risks are unsafe electrical work carried out by people who are not
competent, giving rise to danger of fire and electric shock, and most exhibition and
show organizers will require an electrical installation certificate for each stand’s
electrical installation before they will allow its connection to the local supply.
Organizers also usually require the inspection and testing and certification of all
electrical equipment (e.g. lighting, sound systems etc.) that is to be used. Major events
are set up by professional engineering staff, and the use of pre-engineered stage
components and systems is well established. Many smaller shows, however, may be
provided for by local electrical contractors, and in very small shows the DIYer may
be tempted to do his own work, with all the problems that may provide!
The environmental conditions must be properly assessed, and can range from
agriculture shows in open fields, with attendant livestock, to exhibitions in regularly
used purpose-built halls. The protective measures of obstacles or placing out
of reach are not permitted, as they cannot be successfully managed, and non-
conductive locations or earth-free local equipotential bonding are not permitted,
as they are not under the continuous control of a competent person.
Generally, electrical systems should be as simple and robust as possible, and
modular installation systems with plug and socket outlet connections have been
developed to go with prefabricated modular stand constructions.
G 6.2 Requirements and guidance
The requirements of 711 are summarized in Table G 6.1.
Regulation 711.521 requires the selection of cables assuming the installation
contains no fire alarm system in the building accommodating the exhibition or
show. This requirement is not really practical as (apart from small private buildings
such as school halls) all buildings open to the public in the UK will be subject to
prior inspection by the local authority for licensing, and adequate fire alarm and
emergency escape provisions are required for licensing. Even if this is not the case

Adequate quantity of socket outlets shall be provided 711.55.7
A visible switch shall be provided for signs, lamps or exhibit circuits 711.559.4.7
Installation shall be inspected and tested after each assembly 711.6
(as explained in the selection of cables section under Section D 5.4.1), the only BS
EN cables that do not comply with BS EN 60332–1–2 are butyl flexes.
All supply cables are required to be protected against damage by an RCD with a
rated residual operating current that does not exceed 300 mA, and all final circuits
on the stand are to be protected by 30 mA RCD. This includes socket outlets rated
up to and including 32 A. BS 7671, however, excludes emergency lighting circuits,
but generally emergency lighting will be provided elsewhere in a building or show
as part of the overall emergency escape policy and will not be a part of the stand
(unless it is a very large stand with internal rooms or partitions), and emergency
lighting will usually be of the self-contained type, so this exclusion is not relevant.
Installation methods must take into account the access of members of the public
in relatively large numbers, and the fact that these persons generally will be more
interested in the exhibition or show than anything else, and so cables must be run
in safe locations away from damage, trip hazards and wear from users (e.g. foot
245 G
G 7 G 7.1 G

or vehicle traffic), and armoured cables or other protection should be used where
there is expected to be any risk of damage.
It is desirable that switchgear and control gear is not accessible to the general
public and should be enclosed in lockable cabinets or similar.
Most exhibition halls and shows have specific licensing and inspection requirements
or rules for exhibitors, e.g. the Amusement Devices Inspection Procedures Scheme
(ADIPS). This was introduced by the industry with HSE support, and provides
for third party safety inspections for entertainment and amusement devices and
rides. Current approval documentation from such an inspection may need to be
shown to the organizers, along with electrical installation and electrical equipment
inspection and testing certification.
Solar photovoltaic (PV) power supply systems (712)
Introduction, principles and terminology
BS 7671 includes Section 712, which, to give it its full title, is ‘Solar Photovoltaic
(PV) Power Supply Systems’. The purpose for inclusion of this new section in BS
7671 is only concerned with safety.
In this section of the book, terms used to describe the subject are PV cells (individual
cells), PV strings (a circuit arrangement of PV cells), PV arrays (a general term for
a collection of cells, possibly comprising a number of PV strings) and PV system
(the cells or arrays, their control and connection); the terms are generally expanded
upon and illustrated in this section.
A PV system is a collection of interconnected PV cells that turn sunlight directly
into electrical energy, and consequently needs to be installed outside (usually at
roof level); so any external electrical work has to be suitable for the environment
and correctly IP rated. PV arrays and equipment must conform with the relevant
equipment Standards, i.e. BS EN 61215.
PV arrays are just one of several sources of sustainable energy (e.g. wind turbines),
and all have similar connection requirements to run in parallel with the Regional
Electricity Companies’ mains supply. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)
has published a guidance document on the installation and connection of such
sources (Photovoltaics in Buildings, 2nd Edition printed 2006 {URN 06/1972}),
and this provides detailed information on installation requirements.

Guide to the Wiring Regulations
PV arrays produce electricity at a voltage dependent upon the physical
characteristics of the array and its construction, and the series and parallel
interconnection of PV cells within an array. These are all set during the
manufacturing process and the electrical contractor only has to install the system
to the manufacturer’s details.
As the PV array is a source of energy, it is effectively live at all times and cannot
be isolated (like a battery). The array output voltage is dependent on the array
construction and the load current, and needs to be provided by the manufacturer’s
designer. When on load, like any source, the terminal voltage can fall to zero at
high load, but will recover when the load is removed.
Figure G 7.1 shows the no-load current-voltage characteristic of a typical PV cell,
and Figure G 7.2 shows a typical loaded power–voltage characteristic.

G 7.3 Notes and guidance
It is required to provide an isolator in a suitable location on the d.c. output from
the array, and it must be noted that the cables from the array to this isolator will
always be live, and must be of a suitable construction to withstand thermal and
mechanical damage.
The general method of installation is outlined in Figure G 7.3, but PV arrays are at
present specially manufactured items, usually supplied as a complete system with
the converter and specialist installation in a ‘package’.
There are mandatory requirements concerning parallel connection of ‘generators’
before installations can be interconnected with the supply network. Section 551
of BS 7671 has general regulations on these connections (see 551 and Section D
9 of this book). The permission of the local distribution network operator (DNO,
formerly known as REC) must be obtained, and this is a relatively simple, formal
process for small domestic systems up to 5 kW, but the process becomes considerably
more complex for larger commercial projects.

To aid designers and installers the DNOs have issued Engineering Recommendations
to assist in designing and specifying systems correctly for their approval.
Recommendation G83/1 is for PV systems up to 5 kW, and G59/1 covers PV and
other systems above 5 kW. These documents can be purchased from the Energy
Networks Association.
Protection by the use of Class II (double insulated) or equivalent insulation is
advised for the d.c. system from the array, but it is permitted to earth the d.c. side
at one point if there is at least separation with the use of basic insulation between
the d.c. and a.c. sides.
All equipment used on the d.c. side must be suitable for d.c. voltages and
currents, equipment approved to normal a.c. standards will not be suitable
(especially switchgear), and the designer should clarify standards and performance
requirements with equipment manufacturers.
PV arrays must be installed by competent persons to an approved design, and
planning and building regulations approvals may be required. As they are fixed
to the outside of a building they will be subject to all environmental conditions
including storms and high winds, so the construction and weather sealing must
be sound. The installation must also be accessible for any repair or maintenance,
although with no moving parts this should be minimal. The arrays are to be
installed to allow adequate ventilation to prevent any heat build-up, especially to
electrical equipment and components.
Depending on the design of the arrays, overcurrent protection may not be necessary
on the d.c. side cables as there is a limit to the current output of the array.
ISC STC is the short circuit current of a PV module or array under standard test
conditions, and VOC STC is the open circuit voltage under standard test conditions of
an unloaded PV module or array on the d.c. side of the system. If the continuous
current-carrying capacity of any d.c. cable at any point is at least 1.25 ISC STC with
any de-rating factors taken into account, overcurrent protection is not required.
Short circuit protection, however, must be provided at the connection to the a.c.
mains for the a.c. side supply cable, in accordance with the normal requirements
of Part 4 of BS 7671, to prevent damage from an a.c. side fault (see Figure G
7.3).

to minimize the possible risks of damage and faults, and further protection or
armoured cabling may be necessary.
Plug and socket connectors, specific to PV systems, are commonly fitted to module
cables by the manufacturer. Such connectors provide a secure, durable and effective
electrical contact. They also simplify and increase the safety of installation works.
They are recommended in particular for any installation being performed by a
non-PV specialist, for example, a PV array being installed by a roofer.

G 8 Mobile or transportable units (717)
G 8.1 Scope and application
New for the 17th Edition, this is perhaps the most unusual section of the special
locations, as it covers a wide range of units from specialist broadcast vehicles to
simple skid-mounted units. Generally all such units are prefabricated to specific
user specifications and technical standards, and the general electrical consulting
engineer or electrical contractor will have little to do with their construction.
You may now ask why this section has been included within the book. Although
the design of the units is carried out by manufacturers, questions concerning
connection to the units, or their inspection, are ones that are frequently put to
electrical contractors.
The scope of the section states that the ‘units’ are intended to mean either a mobile
vehicle unit or a transportable unit; for example, a container.
It cites examples as: technical and facilities vehicles for the entertainment industry,
medical services, advertising, fire fighting, workshops/offices and transportable
catering units. It then lists exclusions such as generating sets, marinas and pleasure
craft, mobile machinery to BS EN 60204–1 (Safety of Machinery).
Thus the whole application of Section 717 is confused, as it could be applied to a
collection of temporary site buildings, or Portakabins® used as wards for the local
NHS hospital.
Whilst some of the measures in this section would be suitable, such constructions
would not normally be expected to be ‘special locations’ and the normal installation
requirements of Parts 1 to 5 of BS 7671 would be adequate. This book, therefore,
limits itself to specialist mobile units; even this is not easy to define but would
include, for example, outside broadcast mobile vehicles.
To throw some advice at those of you who are a little lost, perhaps a solution would
be to consider the requirements given in Section G 8.2; there is not a vast quantity
and they are not particularly difficult to apply. One option open therefore would
be, if in doubt, to apply the requirements anyway.

717.411.6.2
G 8.2 Requirements
The requirements of Section 717 are summarized in Table G 8.1; some of these
requirements are items that should or can only be undertaken at the manufacturing
stage.
G 8.3 Notes and guidance
Generally for such units a TN-C-S supply system is not allowable, due to the
possible dangers associated with a broken or disconnected neutral making the
earth a part of the circuit, and the need to properly control and maintain such a
supply system; not easily practical in most ‘temporary’ locations.
The integrity of earthing and bonding connections is obviously of considerable
concern in such mobile units, where vibration can be a considerable problem, and
the Regulations require that all accessible metalwork parts of the unit are to be
connected through a finely stranded protective bonding conductor to the main
earthing terminal of the unit. A note to Regulation 717.411.3.1.2 suggests that
cable types H05V-K and H07V-K to BS 6004 are appropriate stranded cable
types. Generally, however, as discussed previously, such mobile or transportable
units are designed by specialists for special applications and any earthing and
G
254
Special Locations
bonding connections should be carried out by the contractor to the instructions of
the equipment designer.
Generally, the protective measure of automatic disconnection of the supply is
achieved by the use of an RCD.
Some specialist units such as broadcast vehicles do not use RCDs on their earthing
system, as the sudden interruption of supply could not be tolerated. These
installations are always under the control of competent persons during operation,
and the earth current is closely monitored.
Small units may be operated more practically as an IT system (isolated from earth).
The ‘first fault’ will not cause operation of any protective device, but the unit
should be constructed and operated to minimize the likelihood of any such fault.
BS 7671 however, allows IT systems to be provided only by either the use of an
insulation monitoring device or by the use of simple electrical separation. Simple
separation must itself provide for the use of an insulation monitoring device
providing automatic disconnection at first fault, or the use of a 30 mA RCD
complying with Regulation 415.1.1 of BS 7671 (30 mA).
As with all special locations there is increased risk of danger if the installation is
not properly designed, constructed and commissioned, and then properly operated
and maintained by competent persons. As such units will usually be used outside,
and be subject to continual movement and handling, the electrical equipment must
be suitably rated, environmentally protected, of good quality and be to relevant
British or equivalent Standards.
Cables for internal wiring of units may be PVC insulated single-core to BS
6004 installed in conduit; but if there is any possibility of vibration, all-insulated
conductors, or even flexible stranded conductors, should be used.
Cables for connecting the unit to the supply must be of flexible type, and suitable
for their environment and method of use. Such cables should be protected if there
is any likelihood of damage (e.g. foot or vehicle traffic) and protected from any
abrasion. BS 7671 recommends that flexible H05RN-F or H07RN-F cable of a
minimum 2.5 mm2 cross-sectional area be used, but this may need to be increased
for reasons of voltage drop.
Plugs and socket outlets are to be industrial type to BS EN 60309–2, insulated
construction only, and be suitably IP rated to a minimum of IP44 outside. The
plug-top shall be on the unit.

mobile units; these diagrams are most confusing and do not greatly extend the
reader’s knowledge.
G 9 Floor and ceiling heating systems (753)
G 9.1 Introduction
Section 753 ‘Floor and Ceiling Heating Systems’ is new to BS 7671: 2008. Readers
may wonder whether this is Section 753 or 53rd in the series of Part 7s. The
answer is that within IEC, there are many Part 7s either drafted or planned.
Electric floor and ceiling heating systems are mainly used in domestic and similar
installations and are usually buried in the building fabric.
The main risks of such systems are overheating and physical damage after
installation, as the systems are not visible but buried at a shallow depth.
G 9.2 Requirements
Again the requirements have been summarized in a Table, G 9.1.
Table G 9.1 Requirement Floor and ceiling heating requirements.
Regulation
Automatic disconnection shall be by a 30 mA RCD 753.411.3.2
Heating units (cables, tape or panels) that are not manufactured with a conductive
covering or mesh shall be protected with a metal mesh or grid with spacing of not more
than 30 mm
753.411.3.2
A maximum temperature of 80°C operating temperature shall be achieved by design,
installation or by sensing. Floor areas shall have a lower temperature for skin comfort
(say 35°C)
753.424.1.1
753.423
Heating cables shall be to BS 6351 and flexible sheet panels to BS EN 60335–2-96 753.511
Heating units (cables, type of panels) for floor installation shall be to IPX7 753.512.2.5
Information shall be given to the user of the installation (see Section G 9.3) 753.514
G
256
Special Locations
G 9.3 Notes and guidance
Systems are to be protected by a 30 mA RCD. If heaters do not have an integral
conductive covering or sheath (an exposed-conductive-part), a conductive covering
with a spacing of not more than 30 mm (e.g. a grid or mesh) is to be provided
at installation as an exposed-conductive-part over the heating system. See also
Regulation 701.753 for bathrooms.
A grid or mesh will not provide full mechanical protection against physical damage
from nails, screws and the like, but is intended to provide a conductive path to
earth, and not physical protection in its own right.
A Class II heating system (or of equivalent construction) is also to be provided with
additional protection by using a 30 mA RCD.
Unfortunately, RCDs can be subject to unwanted tripping, and so the load on
each RCD should be limited to ensure that any leakage current is limited to levels
that will not cause unwanted operation of the RCD. A maximum circuit load
of 7.5 kW for single-phase loads or 13 kW for three-phase loads are suggested in
Section 753.
All such heating systems must be installed in accordance with manufacturers’
instructions, and the possible temperature of connections and the local ambient
temperatures must be considered in any installation.
It is required that the installer (or designer) provides a record drawing for each
heating system installed showing its location, area, rating details and, indeed, far
more information than will ever actually be provided, in most cases.
The complete list of information to be provided is given below.
A description of the heating system shall be provided by the installer of the
heating system to the owner of the building or his/her agent upon completion
of the installation.
The description shall contain at least the following information:
a) Description of the construction of the heating system, which must include
the installation depth of the heating units.
b) Location diagram with information concerning:
• the distribution of the heating circuits and their rated power;
257 G
Guide to the Wiring Regulations
• the position of the heating units in each room;
• conditions which have been taken into account when installing the
heating units, for example, heating-free areas, complementary heating
zones, unheated areas for fixing means penetrating into the floor
covering.
c) Data on the control equipment used, with relevant circuit diagrams and
the dimensioned position of floor temperature and weather conditions
sensors, if any.
d) Data on the type of heating units and their maximum operating
temperature.
The installer shall inform the owner that the description of the heating system
includes all necessary information, for example, for repair work.
The installer shall provide the owner with a description of the heating system
including all necessary information, for example, to permit repair work.
In addition, the installer shall provide instructions for use of the heating
installation.
The designer/installer of the heating system shall hand over an appropriate
number of instructions for use to the owner or his/her agent upon
completion. One copy of the instructions for use shall be permanently fixed
in or near each relevant distribution board.
The instructions for use shall include at least the following information:
a) Description of the heating system and its function.
b) Operation of the heating installation in the first heating period in the
case of a new building, for example, regarding drying out.
c) Operation of the control equipment for the heating system in the dwelling
area and the complementary heating zones as well, if any.
d) Information on restrictions on placing of furniture or similar. Information
provided to the owner shall cover the restrictions, if any, including:
• whether additional floor coverings are permitted, for example, carpets
with a thickness of >10 mm may lead to higher floor temperatures
which can adversely affect the performance of the heating system;
• where pieces of furniture solidly covering the floor and/or built-in
cupboards may be placed on heating-free areas;
• where furniture, such as carpets, seating and rest furniture with
pelmets, which in part do not solidly cover the floor, may not be
placed in complementary heating zones, if any.
G
258
Special Locations
e) f) Information on restrictions on placing of furniture or similar.
In the case of ceiling heating systems, restrictions regarding the height of
furniture. Cupboards of room height may be placed only below the area
of ceiling where no heating elements are installed.
g) Dimensioned position of complementary heating zones and placing
areas.
h) Statement that, in the case of thermal floor and ceiling heating systems,
no fixing shall be made into the floor and ceiling respectively. Excluded
from this requirement are unheated areas. Alternatives shall be given,
where applicable.
